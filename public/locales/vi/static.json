It is not possible to register an account with the date of birth set to lower than 18 years of age, and if there is under any circumstances suspicion of a minor registering a fake date of birth, we will close the account till the customer is able to send a valid ID, and in some cases a face ID (picture where the customer is holding the ID next to his face).</p>\n\n<h2>First deposit</h2>\n\n<p>Upon the first deposit, all customers will receive an email explaining in detail about FEs KYC process, which mainly involves verifying their account information and chosen payment methods by sending documents. The customer will not be able to get a withdrawal approved until the relevant documents are approved by FEs payments team.</p>\n\n<h2>Verification</h2>\n\n<p>FE requires a valid government issued ID and proof of address in order to verify the customer’s name, date of birth/age, address and registered country. The proof of address needs to be recent, from the last three months, to prove they are currently living there. Customers also have to send documents proving their payment option. This is part of the first stage DD checks known as “Simplified Due Diligence” check and shall be carried out on all customers who reach EUR2000 in cumulative deposits or the equivalent in any other currency or upon first withdrawal request, whatever applies first.</p>\n\n<p>At this stage, PEP and sanction checks are also carried out by relevant staff. Sanction lists consulted include Interpol, Europol, Consolidated EU Sanction List, UN Consolidated List of Targets, EEAS, Consolidated List. For PEP checks, customers are screened against CIA World Leaders Database; everypolitician.org; EU Members of Parliament. Should a customer appear on a sanction list, this shall be immediately escalated to the MLRO and the customer account shall be closed and reported to relevant authorities in Curacao or any other relevant jurisdiction. If a customer or close family member is discovered to be a PEP, this shall also be immediately flagged to the MLRO. The MLRO shall then decide whether to close the account and terminate the customer relationship, or whether to retain the customer relationship and keep the account open. If this decision is to keep the account open, the customer account shall be treated as high risk and subject to increased monitoring and fulfilment of the enhanced due diligence process.</p>\n\n<p>The second stage of due diligence, known as the “Customer Due Diligence” stage, is carried out when the customer hits EUR10,000 in cumulative deposits or the equivalent in any other currency. At this stage, adverse media checks are carried out on the customer by using public sources. Therefore, depending on the country of residence and nationality, public sources are used to make adverse media checks on customers as necessary by using search engines such as Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo and referencing any media articles or other sources of public information.</p>\n\n<p>The third stage of due diligence, known as the “Enhanced Due Diligence” process (“EDD”) shall be carried out for any customers, or any customers who have reached EUR50,000 in cumulative deposits or the equivalent in any other currency. At this stage, therefore, the customer shall be requested to provide a document proving the source of wealth.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, in all cases for Visa, MasterCard and bank transfers, FE would require copies of the used credit card, where you can clearly see a name and the first six and four last digits of the credit card number. If a bank account is used, FE would also need to verify that the bank account belongs to the same person as the customer, by verifying their bank statement showing customers name, bank account number and the bank logo.</p>\n\n<p>All suspicious transactions shall be immediately escalated to the MLRO. The MLRO will then decide  whether the filing of a suspicious transaction report with the relevant authorities in Curacao and/or  the relevant country of residence of the customer as appropriate is required. If a report is not made, the MLRO shall document the reason as to why this decision was made and retain all necessary  information on the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"privacy\">Privacy & Management of Persoal Data</h1>\n\n <p>Data subjects have the right of access to information held by Betfinal, subject to the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000.

New studios have emerged in the past couple of years, each one offering something unique. While some may be looking for their spot under the sun, others are definitely aiming for unchallenged peaks. Booming Games is one of those studios, developing slots with creative ways to win and impressive artwork.</p>\r\n \r\n <p>The studio’s portfolio features over 150 slots. Available at Betfinal, Booming Games’ top slots offer fantastic rewards and a unique experience overall. If you’re looking for an up-and-coming studio with slots that are not simple clones, Booming Games’ library is a definite must.</p>\r\n \r\n <p>You can try all the slot games at Betfinal for free or real money when you’re ready for it.</p>\r\n \r\n <h2>An Up-and-Coming Software Provider</h2>\r\n \r\n <p>Booming Games was launched in 2014 as a relatively small provider. Its name emerged on the scene in the past couple of years thanks to hits such as Cash Pig and the classic duo Burning Classics and Freezing Classics. The success of these slot games fueled Booming’s rise on the market. Every new slot was bigger and better than its predecessors, cementing Booming Games’ presence on the market.</p>\r\n \r\n <p>Players are impressed by the fantastic graphics and innovative ways to win. Booming’s slot games are loaded with great features that can pay the big bucks. They’re all developed on the HTML5 platform and available across a range of mobile devices.</p>\r\n \r\n <p>If you’re looking for an up-and-coming provider with plenty of great hits, Booming is the real deal.</p>\r\n \r\n <h2>Impressive Artwork and Gameplay Features</h2>\r\n \r\n <p>One of the first things you’ll notice in Booming Games’ slots is the impressive artwork. While not all players pay attention to the style, we believe it’s very important for the overall experience. After all, what good is spinning a slot with modern features if it looks like it was released in 1995?</p>\r\n \r\n <p>Booming Games’ slots strike a perfect balance between impressive features and amazing artwork. Book of Tombs, for example, is a classic slot in its core, but looks pretty modern. The 3D animations in Wombaroo are another perfect example of why we love Booming’s slots so much.</p>\r\n \r\n <p>They’re certainly not all about style. These games often feature mechanics such as Hold & Win that can easily deliver cash rewards worth thousands of times your stake.</p>\r\n \r\n <h2>Unique Bonus Rounds</h2>\r\n \r\n <p>Play any Booming Games slot at Betfinal and you’ll be impressed by the number of bonus features. Cash Pig and Wombaroo are the best examples of it. Both feature a free spins round spiced up with value coins that are collected for massive cash prizes.</p>\r\n \r\n <p>Slots such as Cash Pig also use elimination features and upgrade symbols that can turn your low-win spins to major scores. Burning Classics and Freezing Classics represent Booming’s classic portfolio. However, these aren’t good ol’ fruit machines. They’ve been boosted by modern mechanics and bonuses that ups the ante and makes them a true classic in the world of post-modern slots.</p>\r\n \r\n <p><a class=\"staticPageButton staticPageGoBack\" href=\"/\">« Go back</a></p>","provider-booming-games-title":"Betfinal – Enjoy Booming Games’ Classics and New Slots","provider-evolution-description":"Are Evolution Gaming’s live casino games that good?

In less than 10 years on the market, the company has managed to deliver just under 100 online slots. It’s constantly working hard to improve its offer, adding new features to its arsenal that make the studio’s titles all the more impressive.</p>\r\n \r\n <p>Built on HTML5, GameArt’s slots have gained a lot of traction in the past few years.

The Maltese studio’s slots have entered the slot market atmosphere in the past few years, with each new game bigger and better than its predecessors.</p>\r\n \r\n <p>Slot games such as African Sunset 2 have done great things for GameArt’s reputation. The ones that truly took GameArt to the top are Mega Bunny Hyperways and Diego el Pibe de Oro.

The slot developer doesn’t stick to classics or specific themes. Instead, it has opted for versatility which appeals to different types of players.</p>\r\n \r\n <p>Nefertiti’s Nile, for example, is a modern take on classic Egyptian themes. So is African Sunset 2, the sequel to the original African Sunset slot. When it comes to modern slots with high-paying mechanics, GameArt can be proud of Mega Bunny Hyperways. It’s a cartoonish slot with 3D graphics and a lighthearted theme boosted by a great math model.</p>\r\n \r\n <p>Sports fans will undoubtedly enjoy the Maradona homage in Diego el Pibe de Oro. It perfectly captures Don Diego’s lavish lifestyle with unique features and special symbols that can deliver solid cash rewards.</p>\r\n \r\n <h2>Sky High Payouts with No Holds Barred</h2>\r\n \r\n <p>Aside from the theme versatility, GameArt’s slot games excel with fantastic payouts.
