The only difference is that the Apertura and Clausura are both leagues on their own. The last time this system was used was the 2016-2017 season; ever since the league is being played on a yearly basis, with 18 teams competing in its most recent edition. The Primera Division has been home to a couple of big talents; for example, both Alexis Sánchez and Arturo Vidal started in the Primera Division, and have great careers ever since.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>\r\nPrimera Division betting options\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nWe give you the opportunity to bet on any Primera Division game you want.

For the title the league is split up into groups from which the winners face each other in a two legged final. In a nutshell, the Primera A is a great league to bet on. So dig up some information about the big clubs such as América de Cali and Atlético Nacional de Medellín and start betting. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>\r\nBet Builder and Combo Markets\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nFor each game in Primera A there are lots of betting options to choose from: winners, goal scorers, cards, handicaps and so on. You can pick single bets from the entire list or you can use the Bet Builder to combine several odds for the same game. For instance if you think Once Caldas will win against Atletico Bucaramanga after trailing 0-1 at half time you can combine the two to build a bet. \r\n</p> \r\n<p>\r\nIf you want to, you can also find pre-built combo bets in the Combo Markets.

The league where dreams are born and hopes are shattered, where small town clubs surprise everyone and grab the title and big teams relegate after just been in the highest tier shortly before.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>\r\nDozens of bets on a weekly basis\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nWith 12 games each round and a total of 46 rounds (and that’s even without the playoffs for promotion) there is almost too much to choose from when it comes to Championship betting. The lower leagues in England are known for their rough defenders, toothless strikers and wingers as fast as lightning. But if you mix it up with teams accustomed to the Premier League you’ll get a special cocktail that is unparalleled. So take your pick out of all the different available bets per game! You can bet on the traditional home win, draw or away win but you can also bet on details such as cards, corners and even goal scorers. Use the handicap if you’re sure a team is going to win by more than one goal. To raise the possible pay out you can combine several bets to build a bigger bet.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>\r\nOutrights\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nBeing the league of surprises it is hard to predict who’ll go up the Premier League or who is destined to go down to League One. Making the Championship a very interesting and challenging league to place a bet on the outrights. Whether you have a hunch your favourite team will finally take the big leap into the highest tier or you are sure the newly promoted teams will return to the League One.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>\r\nCash out\r\n</h2>\r\n<p> \r\nWant to cash out before the event is finished? Check your bet to see if it is still possible! For instance if your predicted winner is 1-0 ahead but you’ve got the feeling they are going to give away their lead, you can choose to cash out and therefore quit the bet prematurely. The money will quickly be added to your balance for further use. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2> \r\nPayment methods and settlements\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nTo make the experience as convenient as possible we offer you several payment methods to add money to your balance. You can use VISA or MasterCard as well as your e-wallet or payment platforms such as EcoPayz and MuchBetter. After your bet is settled the money is added to your balance as soon as possible. This way you can instantly use your winnings to play a new game or withdraw it to your bank account.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\nThe Championship\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nBeing the gateway to the most popular league in the world there is a lot at stake in the Championship. This adds to the already lively experience in lower league English football. The pressure is immense, the stakes are high and teams are getting better and better every year. All in all, a great league to place your bets on!\r\n</p>","/sports/football/england/championship-title":"Championship","/sports/football/england/premier-league-description":"Bet on the Premier League with Betfinal | The best odds | Various payment options ","/sports/football/england/premier-league-html":"<h1>Bet on the Premier League</h1>\r\n<p>The Premier League, considered by many to be the best league in the world.

Right here at Betfinal you can bet on all the major English leagues from the Premier League to League Two. This means there are hundreds of different bets to be placed every week! Take a look at the schedule, find out what the odds are and let your football knowledge prevail.</p>\r\n<h2>The highest domestic leagues</h2>\r\n<p>We offer countless different bets and odds for all the games in the four highest tiers of football in England:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.betfinal.com/sports/football/england/premier-league\">Premier League</a></li> \r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.betfinal.com/sports/football/england/championship\">Championship</a> </li> \r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.betfinal.com/sports/football/england/league-one\">League One</a></li> \r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.betfinal.com/sports/football/england/league-two\">League Two</a></li> \r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This means you can bet on some of the best teams in the country (and the world) such as Manchester City and Liverpool. But you can also find sleeping giants like Sunderland and Nottingham Forest in the lower leagues. So immerse yourself in English football and place your bets!</p>\r\n<h2>Bet on English football</h2>\r\n<p>You can bet on several match events ranging from the winner to the correct score and the number of awarded corners to goalscorers. Mix it up by making combinations and raise the stakes on your bet. You can also use your crystal ball to predict the title winners and relegation candidates. When you’ve made your predictions you can easily find them on your bet slip and place your bet.</p> \r\n<h2>How do odds work?</h2>\t\r\n<p>For every outcome there is an odd set to the probability of the outcome. The lower the chance of something happening the higher the stakes. When you decide to make a combination of bets the odds will multiply by each other. For example: if you predict a win for Arsenal with an odd of 2.0 in combination with a total amount of over 5,5 cards in the game between Stoke City and Derby County with an odd of 3.25 the total accumulation will be 6.5. Please note: we use European odds, they are different to British odds.</p>\r\n<h2>Cash out</h2>\r\n<p>Betfinal offers you the opportunity to cash out before an event is finished. We will continuously update the odds of the cash out for your bet. So for instance, you have placed a bet on Liverpool to win the game, they are 1-0 up at half time but you are not certain they will console the lead. Then you have the opportunity to cash out, for a lower odd than the original. A cash out is also possible if the score isn’t in your favour but there is still enough time to change this. In this case the cash out is possibly lower than the wager.</p>\r\n<h3>Fast settlements</h3>\r\n<p>As soon as the event of your bet ends we are ready to add the money to your wallet. You won’t experience any delays or restrictions and can instantly use your winnings for a new game or request a withdrawal.</p>\r\n","/sports/football/england-title":"Football Betting England | Betfinal","/sports/football/france/ligue-1-description":"Bet on all the games in the Ligue 1! | Several payment methods | Quick settlement | Cash out option","/sports/football/france/ligue-1-html":"<h1>\r\nLigue 1 betting\r\n</h1>\r\n<p>\r\nGet in on all the action in the Ligue 1 by betting on games of top teams like Paris Saint-Germain, Olympique Lyonnais, Olympique Marseille and AS Monaco.

Place your bets today at Betfinal!\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>\r\nHow to bet on Iraqi football\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nBetting is fairly easy, especially at Betfinal. There are many possibilities when it comes to betting on Iraqi football. For each game, there are a lot of different betting options. You can not only predict the winner of the match, but also the goal scorers and the number of goals scored before halftime. You can find all the options by clicking on the specific game you want to place your bets on. You can also build your own bet with our Bet Builder. You can place bets on all the single games, but also on the outrights. Do you have a strong feeling that Al-Shorta is going to be the Iraqi champion this year? Predict the outcome of the Iraqi Premier League at Betfinal!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt Betfinal we offer the best odds. Your stake will be multiplied by the odds displayed next to the bet. In general, the odds are higher when an event is more unlikely to happen. This means that if you take the risk and you are right you will be highly rewarded. Betfinal uses European odds. If you use British or American odds the outcome can differ slightly due to round-off errors.  \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>\r\nCash out\r\n </h2>\t\r\n<p>\r\nBetting can be risky. Luckly at Betfinal you can get a return on your bets even before the game is finished. For example, you’ve placed a bet on Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya as the winner of the match. It looks like your prediction might become the truth as Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya is taking the lead. But suddenly your gut feeling is telling you that Al-Zawraa is going to make a comeback and will end up winning the match. At this point, you can decide to cash out by just clicking on the cash out button on your betslip. The bigger the chance of your bet still succeeding, the higher the offer will be. Please note that the cash out option is not always available. Especially if your bet is very unlikely to be correct.

European odds are odds that are multiplied by the wager. So for instance if you predict a win for Sassuolo and the European odd is 3.6, the 3.6 will be multiplied by the amount of money you’ve bet on the game. In this case a €10,- bet will get you €36,- if you’re prediction is right.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\nPayment methods\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nTo add to your experience we offer you several convenient payment methods like Visa, Paypal and your e-wallet.

Football, or calcio, has been around in Italy ever since the end of the 19th century.

Make your predictions before the start of the season, sit back and wait for the end of the season.

For instance: you have placed a bet on AC Milan to win against Atalanta Bergamo and for AS Roma to win against Bologna. The first bet is settled, AC Milan won, but you’re not so sure anymore AS Roma will prevail as well after a shaky start of the game. At that moment you can check your bet, see what the cash out offer is and request your cash out. After agreeing to the cash out, the money will immediately be added to your wallet.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>\r\nPay out based on European odds\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nBetfinal uses European odds to calculate your winnings. This means you can place your bets in British or American odds if you’re used to those, but the pay out will be based on European odds. This might mean a slight round-off error, since the odds don’t always exactly translate into British- or American-style odds. European odds are multiplied by your stake. For instance: there is an odd of 4.50 on Empoli to win against Lazio, your stake will be multiplied by 4.50. If you decide to make a combination of bets on multiple games the odds of all separate games will be accumulated into a total combined odd. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPlease note that Betfinal does not use British odds.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\nThe ultimate betting experience\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nIf your predictions were correct we will quickly transfer the money to your online wallet.

This option means you can get a return on your bet while it is not yet finished. For instance: you predict a win for Club America with a 2,15 odd, they are 1-0 up, but you feel like they won’t hold the lead. In this instance you can go to your betslip, check the cash out offer and accept if you think the offer is sufficient.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\nMore information\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nAre you ready to bet on the Liga MX?

Find the best odds at Betfinal and start betting on the United States MLS.","/sports/football/united-states/mls-html":"<h1>\r\nUnited States MLS football betting\r\n</h1>\r\n<p>\r\nFind 27 of the best US football teams in the Major Soccer League (MLS) and place your bet on variables ranging from scores to awarded corners. The MLS is where professional players find their right to fame as they play for some of the county’s biggest teams. Despite not being the national sport of North-America, football ranks among the most popular sports on a global level. This means there are plenty of games for you to bet on – all the while enjoying the user friendly interface offered by Betfinal. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>The highest tier in US football</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nKids in the United States are enrolled in team sports like football from a very young age. It’s no surprise then that some of the best MLS players have been playing at local clubs, to then join the University Soccer League to eventually find a place in one of the country’s top teams. The standards are high for United States football and the MLS ranks among the most exciting leagues to bet on. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDuring the season from March to October, 27 teams from both the United States and Canada take on each other in a race for the Supporter’s Shield. This Shield grants great benefits during the playoffs; a knockout tournament leading up to the MLS cup championship in December. During the regular season, teams provide their best players to feature in an exhibition All-Star Game. The US football league thus differs from e.g. European leagues in set-up and scheduling yet provides entertainment nonetheless! \r\n<p>\r\n<h2>\r\nHigh odds and great potential\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nThe numerous variables in MLS football betting allow for great potential of winning great money. Not only does this league include as much as 27 teams – with plans of expanding to 30 by 2023 – the different phases of the MLS divided into regular and playoffs provide high odds and exciting betting statistics. Betting on MLS games therefore satisfies those who enjoy a gamble but want to stay in control of strategy and gameplay.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor every game played during the MLS season, you’ll find a wide range of betting options. Predict the winning team, the number of corners awarded, the top scorer and more to raise the stakes and increase your potential win. Combine the odds of different games or use our \r\n<a href=\"https://www.betfinal.com/en/sports/bet-builder-rules\">\r\nBet Builder\r\n</a>\r\nto merge multiple bets into one single game. Select your bet of choice and find it added to your betslip where you can instantly see your potential return.\r\n<h2>\r\nCash out at any time\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nWant to secure your winnings? Or minimize your loss? Use our cash out option while a game is still going. When you predicted one team to win and they’re at 1-0 by half time, but you doubt whether they’re able to sustain the lead, cash out and secure your bet. Keep checking your bets to see what the cash out offer is at any time during the game and decide upon the risk you’re willing to take. Not feeling lucky today or certain your winner won’t hold the line until the 90 minute mark? Cash out and find the money transferred to your online wallet.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>\r\nEuropean odds pay-out\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nYour winnings will be calculated based on European odds. You’re free to place bets in British or American odds, but your pay-out will be calculated through our standard odds system. An occasional round-off error may occur since European odds don’t always translate neatly into British or American odds.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo clarify: European odds are multiplied by your stake. So an odd of 4.50 on Atlanta United FC to win against the Portland Timbers translates into a stake being multiplied by 4.50. Were you to decide on combining bets on multiple games, the odds of each game will be accumulated not one total combined odd.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\nMLS football betting on Betfinal\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nIs the MLS your league of interest and do you fancy an exciting round of online betting?

Set your predictions and manage them within your Betfinal account. You may be rewarded instant cash when your predictions turn out to be true! Moreover, we offer a cash-out option to secure yourself of a win.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>\r\nHow do odds work?\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nEvery better needs a strategy. In order to find yours, choosing the right odds is essential. For every game outcome, there’s an odd set to the probability of this particular outcome. The lower the chance of something happening, the higher the stakes. When you decide to make a combination of bets, the odds will multiply by each other. For example: if you predict a win for New York City FC with an odd of 2.0 in combination with a total amount of over 5.5 cards in the game between Sporting Kansas City and FC Dallas with an odd of 3.25, the total accumulation will be 6.5. Please note: we use European odds, they differ from British odds.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>\r\nThe cash-out option\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nBetting can be tricky and not every better is willing to take high risks. To accommodate you in your experience, we offer the opportunity to cash out before a game is finished. We’ll make sure the odds of the cash out for your bet are continuously updated. When you’ve predicted one team will win the game and they take the lead by half time, but doubt whether they’re able to prevail, you’re free to cash out against lower odds than the original. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCash outs are possible too when the current score isn’t in your favour but there’s time enough to change. In this case, the cash out is possibly lower than the wager.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\nThe ultimate betting experience at Betfinal\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nDid your predictions turn out to be right?

Take a look at the fixtures to see which games are currently being played.</p>\r\n<h2>The best odds</h2>\t\r\n<p>At the start of the game the odds will be the similar to the pre-match bets, but as soon as the game progresses the odds change. And then it becomes a matter of timing, do you know exactly when to place your bets at the right time? Because the game changes continuously the odds can raise far above the pre-match odds, meaning you can earn a bigger payout in the end.</p>\r\n<h2>Cash out</h2>\r\n<p>Having second thoughts on your live bet? Or do you think the match will change drastically in the next few minutes? Then there might be a way out by using the cash out option. This option can be activated while your prediction is still right but can also be used sometimes if the odds aren’t in your favour. For instance: with a 0-0 score in the 10th minute you predict a win for the home team, but after 60 minutes the score is 1-1. At that time there is still a chance to win the bet, but the odds will be much lower compared to the moment your team is ahead.</p>\r\n<h2>Live streaming and live stats</h2>\r\n<p>Betfinal offers you everything that’s needed for the ultimate live betting experience including live streaming and live stats so you won’t miss a thing. The live streaming is available for selected competitions and events. The best thing about watching the game as it unfolds is that you’re even more invested in the outcome.</p>\r\n<h2>Our fast settlements</h2>\r\n<p>One of the big advantages of live betting at Betfinal is the fast settlement of your winnings. They will directly be added to your wallet after which you can decide to play on with the proceeds or withdraw it to your bank account. You can even place a new bet on the same game if you’ve chosen to cash out early.</p>\r\n<h3>What is live betting?</h3>\r\n<p>Live betting, or in-play betting grants you the opportunity to place bets during matches. So if you have a certain feeling during a game because a striker is playing better than ever or the goalkeeper looks a bit shaky you can quickly bet on the outcome you expect. This way you can base your prediction on the actual game instead of predicting beforehand.</p>","/sports/football-title":"Live Football Betting","/sports/tennis-description":"Find the best Tennis bets online and join thousands of sports enthusiasts at Betfinal.
