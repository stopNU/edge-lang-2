  "html-31": "<p>With an ever-growing slot and casino portfolio, it can sometimes become hard to keep track of what’s out there and which games are worth a try. That is why we have decided to introduce the <strong>Betfinal Game of the Week</strong>.</p><p>Every Monday we will select a new game to be introduced to you and of course we will pick only the best of the best for you.</p><p>Without further ado, let’s kick this off with a slot that can best be described as “global favorite game meets global favorite feature”: <strong>Chilli Heat Megaways from Pragmatic Play</strong>.</p><p>Pragmatic Play have revamped their smash hit “Chilli Heat” and added the well known and loved Megaways feature. This slot is not only for fans of habaneros, jalapenos and ghost peppers, but a taste for hot and spicy doesn’t hurt either.</p><p>And here’s why this slot is so great:</p><h4>Chilli Heat Megaways Features</h4><p>The spicier it gets, the more cash is ready to be grabbed in this new splendor slot from Pragmatic Play. Thus, the hot Chilli Heat symbol is the wild symbol of this game, which replaces all other symbols (except for the money bags).</p><p>Also, every time you hit a win, all the winning symbols disappear in a fireball to let more symbols move up. This way you can get multiple wins with a single spin!</p><h4>Ante Bet</h4><p>An Ante Bet (i.e. a \"pre-bet\") ensures that more money bags are on the reels, provided you are willing to pay 25% on top of your spin. However, since said money bags are scatter symbols and thus lead you into the free spins round, this bet can be well worth it!</p><h4>Buy Feature</h4><p>That's not fast enough for you? Then just buy the free spins round! For your 100x bet, you can start this directly without any detours.</p><h4>Free Spins</h4><p>Regardless of whether you want to get into the free spins round with Ante Bet, Buy Feature or in the conventional way, you have to place at least 6 money bags on the reel set.</p><p>Once there, your money bags will remain on the reels, while rest will fall victim to the blazing fire!</p><p>Unlike most other free spins, Chilli Heat Megaways gives you 3 respins where you are supposed to place more money bags on the board. Each time you manage to do this, the respin counter is increased to 3 again, so it will continue until you hit no more money bags or all the reels are full.</p><p>In order to achieve the latter, however, you have to unlock the 2 outer reels first. You can do this by using the horizontal reel, on which various bonuses and reel upgrades are distributed. By the way, these can also bring you fat multipliers, thanks to which you can boost your winnings up to 5,000x your bet.</p><p>So much from us! Are your fingers tingling to try the game yet? Off you go, have fun!</p>",

  "html-32": "<p><p>A new week is upon us once again and it is time to introduce our 3rd Game of the Week to you. This time we will take a closer look at <strong>Bigger Bass Bonanza</strong> from Pragmatic Play. With this game Pragmatic have created an upgraded version of their already successful previously released slot game Big Bass Bonanza. </p></p><p><p>Let's talk about the most obvious upgrade right away: Compared to its predecessor, Bigger Bass Bonanza has given the reel set a nice boost. While in Big Bass Bonanza you gamble on a 5x3 field, in this slot you can go fishing with 5x4 reels. That way, you have even more opportunities to hit money symbols, paylines and scatters!</p></p><p><p>Bigger Bass Bonanzaís features summer up: </p></p><p><h4>Money Symbols:</h4><br><p>Speaking of money symbols: These are your best friends in both the base game and the free spins round, and have also been given a lucrative extra feature. As befits a fishing slot, the money symbols swim onto the field as fish with a random win amount. If you catch 4 fish on a payline, you will get your 5x bet back (just like in the previous game). However, if you catch 5 fish, Bigger Bass Bonanza will give you the <strong>sum of all the winning amounts </strong> that are shown on the fish!</p></p><p><h4>Bigger Bass Free Spins</h4><br><p>As already indicated, this tasty catch also plays a big role in the free spins round. If you make it into this one with at least 3 scatters, you don't have to pull the fish out of the water with paylines anymore, but let your fishing buddy do it.</p></p><p><p>By the way, this bearded guy with the somewhat questionable fashion taste has another interesting feature in store: For every 4 fisherman symbols you get <strong>10 new free spins</strong> and all money symbol wins are then provided with a multiplier. If you manage this 3 times, this even increases to 10x.</p></p><p><p>Summed up: You can really expect a record-breaking catch here. So give it a go!</p></p>",

In today’s episode we take you into the world of Ganesha, also known as Ganapati and Vinayak, one of the best-known and most worshipped deities in the Hindu pantheon. Easily identified by his elephant head, he is not only known as the remover of obstacles but also thought to bring good luck. And what’s better than good luck when playing slots? </span><br><br><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Ganesha himself fittingly represents the Wild symbol in the slot and of course brings along his temple as a Scatter symbol to trigger free spins and a Bonus symbol, that appears on all reels but pays only in the bonus game. </span></p><p><br> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Ganesha Boost Hold & Win Features: </span></p><p><br> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Boost Feature:</strong></span><br><span style=\"color:#000000;\">If you hit the Boost symbol and any Bonus symbol in a spin, this will trigger the Boost feature for you.

During the main game and free spins, the boost symbol will appear only on the 3rd reel. In the bonus round however, the symbol can hit on any reel. </span></p><p><br> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Ganesha Hold & Win Free Spins</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">As usual, the free spins round is triggered by 3 or more Scatter Symbols. Starting of with 10 free spin rounds, you can re-trigger the free spins and add an additional 10 rounds every time you hit another 3 Scatters during the feature. And Ganesha would not be the bringer of good luck, without an additional role in the feature. During the free spins, he transforms from a normal Wild into a Wild X2, thus doubling the win of each combination he is part of. </span></p><p><br> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>The Bonus Game:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">6 or more Bonus symbols will take you straight into the bonus round, offering you 3 re-spins to start with. The Bonus symbols will become sticky during the feature and stay on the reels, while you go on to collect more of them. With each new Bonus symbol appearing on the reels, the re-spin amount will be reset to 3. This feature will continue, until the re-spins are finished or all 15 positions on the reels are filled with Bonus symbols. Once the feature comes to an end, the values of all Bonus symbols are added together and credited as bonus win. </span></p><p><br> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Jackpots: </strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">To round things up, Ganesha also has thrown a few nice jackpots into the mix. For you to win one of them, you first need to enter into the bonus round. Once this feature is triggered, Mini, Minor and Major Jackpost symbols randomly appear on the reels, giving you the corresponding jackpots.  Should you collect all 15 Bonus symbols of any type, you will hit the jackpot - literally, as that will award the GRAND Jackpot of the game. </span></p><p><br> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Now it’s your turn. Go and see if Ganesha is also your lucky charm. </span></p>",

So get ready for a colorful cash party with expanding reels!</span></p><p><br> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Cash Bonanza Features</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Let's start with the basics: To collect a win, you need to line up at least 3 identical symbols from left to right, and it doesn't matter where on the reel you place each symbol.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Once you have a win, both the symbols in the payline and the same symbols outside the payline remain on the field. That means, for example, if you have 3 lemons lined up and there is also a lemon on the 5th reel, you will keep it as well.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Why do you need this? After these symbols are set, you get a free respin in which the reel set is expanded vertically by one row. If you also hit a win on the respin, it continues in the same way, so that on the 4th respin, instead of the 4x6 set of reels, you're looking at a whopping 8x6 fields with 262,144 ways to win!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">What this means for you and your winning chances, we don't have to explain to you at this point, do we? </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Freespins Round</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">This feature gets even better once you make it to the free spins round with at least 3 scatter symbols. Once there, you get to enjoy the same reel-expanding respins, but they don't reset between your free spins.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Or in other words, as you progress through the free spins round, you'll have more and more ways to win, making big winning combinations much more likely than in the base game!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">While you are increasing your chances of winning, you can also earn a win multiplier with your respins. This starts at the 1st respin with 1x, to amount to 2x at the 2nd respin. This continues until you have completely filled the reels or do not hit another respin.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Not bad, is it? And to make this fun last as long as possible, you can trigger 4 more free spins with just 2 scatters.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">As you can see, the name Cash Bonanza really says it all - why don't you give it a try?</span></p><p><br> </p>",

It looks much more retro however, with its fruits and sevens. This juicy slot lays on a sandy beach with tropical music. It also pays more than its spicy counterpart with up to 2,000 x your bet!</span></p>",

But unlike in real life, these animals are no threat to you - quite the opposite, they bring nothing but excitement and wins. </span></p><p><br> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">With 1024 ways to win and the option to buy yourself straight into the game feature, this slot offers all the heart desires.

You will then have the option of purchasing another spin as long as you did not win any of the 3 jackpots. If you purchased another spin – the win amount will be added to the previous bonus winnings. The total bet is the same as the game that triggered the bonus round and the bonus game can be triggered during base game only.</span></p><p><br> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Free Spins Feature</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">If the mystery coin lands on its “Free Spins” side, the free spins game will be triggered.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">During free spins, you will receive 4 progress bars of medium symbols and need to collect 5 scattered golden rhino symbols to complete each progress bar.

Now’s your chance as we are handing you $10 worth of free chips to discover it!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">How to claim your $10 free play bonus? Simply deposit $20 or more and head to the game. Easy, right?!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">As a fellow astronaut once said: “That's one small step to play. One giant leap to cosmic wins!”</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">How to play AstroBoomers: To The Moon!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">AstroBoomers is the latest creation by the Spearhead Studios. It’s easy and fun and has tremendous winning potential with multipliers from 1.01x all the way to 2,500x your bet!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The game starts on Earth, where you board the rocket with one, two or three pilots representing your bets. Each bet can range from $0.10 to $100. You’ve got 15 seconds to place your bets before the rocket takes off.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Once in space, the multiplier starts to increase rapidly. But you will need nerves of steel as you fly through a meteoroids field and must click the Eject button to save your pilots and collect rewards.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Should your spaceship crash before ejecting your pilots, you lose your bet. However, the longer your pilots travel without blowing up, the higher the multiplier, hence the higher your rewards!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">AstroBoomers: To The Moon! game features</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">AstroBoomers is not burdened with many features taking your attention away from just playing the game! It’s all about your initial bets and the multipliers. You can place one, two or three bets represented by the yellow astronauts. You are then in control as to when you close each bet by pressing the Eject buttons. In the meantime, the multiplier increases.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">For each yellow pilot ejected before the rocket explodes, you collect winnings equal to the corresponding bet x multiplier when ejecting. Each astronaut can eject individually, thus collecting his own rewards!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You’ve got an “Auto” option just under each Bet button. There, you can select at which multiplier you want your pilots to auto-eject. Say you select 2x in Auto, your pilot will eject automatically when the multiplier reaches 2x without the need for you to press Eject.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Once you’ve found the best strategy combining your three bets and the auto-eject, use the Re-bet function and just lay back as the countdown to launch reaches zero.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">AstroBoomers is also interactive and real time. Your fellow players, or “Boomers”, and their live bets and winnings appear on the top left corner. You can chat with them from the top right corner. At the end of each game, the podium of the best three space pilots pops up on screen. Be sure to put your name on it!</span></p><p><br> </p>",

These games are thrilling nonetheless and offer great betting opportunities.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Added benefit: you can follow the game live at Betfinal while you place bets with your $10 free bet! Until then, our football experts have once again some insights and betting tips to share with you…</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Fulham, under (Premier) pressure</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">London’s oldest football club is currently leading the Championship’s leaderboard. Statistically impressive, Fulham will be an obvious favorite at home in Craven Cottage.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">But it’s not all roses on Fulham’s bench. The squad comes from been relegated after just one season back in Premier League. The irregular results and back-and-forths between Premier and Championship have seen an important turnover of head coaches since 2018. Now, Marco Silva has the clear mission (and pressure) to return the squad to the top English league. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Fulham leads the league with an impressive 13 wins and just 3 losses. And 50 goals scored so far, including 3 hat-tricks by Mitrović. But the last three matchdays have been fairly disappointing with 3 consecutive draws and just 2 goals scored. We expect the Cottagers to shake things up for their fans. Bets over 2,5 and Mitrović to score might seem risky right now, but it would pay off.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Luton Town might surprise</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">On the opposite side of the pitch, Luton Town arrives at the Craven Cottage after a 0-3 victory against Blackpool. We expect Adebayo to work his magic and score. Our most daring punters might even want to bet on Luton to win. It’s a risk worth taking when wagering a free bet and it would bring a good return.</span></p><p><br> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">However, the Hatters don’t inspire that much confidence: before their great performance against Blackpool, they spent four matchdays without winning. They are currently at the 12<sup>th</sup> rank of the leaderboard with exactly 7 wins, 7 draws, 7 losses. And now they must face the favorites to win the 2021/22 Championship season. Can they surprise us though?</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></p><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">To claim the free bet, simply select it from the bonus dropdown menu during deposit.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The minimum deposit for this promotion is $20.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free bet amount is $10</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free bet can be used to place any bet on the game Fulham vs Luton Town on the 11.12.21</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The qualifying deposit needs to be wagered at least once with minimum odds of 1.30.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Betfinal´s General Terms and Conditions apply.</span></li></ol>",

Therefore, without further ado, let’s jump straight to the features. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Piggy Bank Bills Features</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">As said before, you can get ready for a completely new gameplay on the brilliantly animated 6x3 grid: Instead of forming clusters or hitting paylines, you only need to staple 2 matching halves of a banknote together. These are worth between 0.25x and 1.000x and can also be completed by a wild symbol.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">By the way, should you not be so lucky, the winning piggy can help you out. This money-hungry pig randomly appears in the base game if you haven't hit a win to throw between 2 and 3 wild symbols onto the field. Since a pair is enough for a win, this feature is a real winning guarantee!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Freespins Round</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Another side effect of the happy banknote coupling: You only have to hit one \"Free Games\" pair to enter the free spins round! Should you catch a 3rd one anywhere on the field, then the two bills with the lowest value will be removed from the game before the 1st round. So you get a lucrative start advantage before it even begins!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Once the free spins finally start, even more tickets will be ripped. After the first round, the first one already goes down, after which the next bills are taken out after every 2nd round. The bill that has the lowest value in the respective round is always the one that has to say goodbye to your free spins round. In this way, only valuable symbols remain at the end of the free spins round, so the chances of a high win are much greater. By the way, since there are fewer bills remaining in play, the possibility of hitting a pair at the end is also much higher!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">It still doesn't stop there though, because the different bills can appear with a multiplier! So you can even triple your winnings with a little luck. Or in other words, if you manage this with a 1,000x bill, you can win your 3,000x bet with just a single spin!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">In that case, your winnings literally are as fat as a pig. But now enough with the bad puns and let’s go to the slot!</span></p>",

As every weekend, you can watch the game with us while you place your wagers with a $10 free bet. So, get in shape and read the betting tips of our <i>calcio</i> experts!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Tough times for Frosinone</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Frosinone might have the advantage to play at home, at the Benito Stirpe Stadium, but this won’t make them favorites to win. The squad hasn’t won a single game in the last five matchdays. Could they turn things around? Maybe. But for now, we are betting on a draw. Especially when placing your bet with the $10 free bet, a draw would bring you a better return.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">This being said, the Canaries will have one major ace up their sleeve: Charpentier. The 22-year-old Frenchman is on loan from Genova until the end of the season. More importantly, he´s been the most consistent at Frosinone, having scored eight goals so far this season. If only one should score, it will be Gabriel Charpentier.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>SPAL, win some, lose some</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The white and blue team of Ferrara is going through its own rollercoaster alternating victories and loses. Head-coach Pep Clotet knows he needs to turn this ship around, as his team is dangerously close to relegation play-out positions. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">But SPAL could surprise everyone. Just this year, the squad reached the quarter-finals of the Italian Cup – a first for a Serie B team. They ultimately fell under the almighty Juventus that went all the way to winning the Coppa. Expect them to put on a good fight, equalizing the score at the very least.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></p><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">To claim the free bet, simply select it from the bonus dropdown menu during deposit.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The minimum deposit for this promotion is $20.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free bet amount is $10</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free bet can be used to place any bet on the game Frosinone vs SPAL on the 18.12.21</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The qualifying deposit needs to be wagered at least once with minimum odds of 1.30.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Betfinal´s General Terms and Conditions apply.</span></li></ol>",

Alternatively, you can set the number of spins and cost per spin in advance when selecting the autoplay option.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Take The Kingdom game features</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong> </strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Your epic adventure starts with a wide selection of weapons: swords, axes, crossbows and morning stars that will pay up every time you collect 3 to 5 on paylines. However, the highest paying symbols are the knight and princess. And moreover, the king that starts rewarding when just two appear on the reels.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The most appealing feature is the Fireball Countdown, where dragon symbols automatically convert into sticky fireballs. And every seven spins, the dragon laying around your reels converts these into wilds! This feature alone will boost your winnings massively!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Look also for the treasure chests. Three of these awards you with 12 free spins! While the dragon rests during in-game free spin rounds, this is not the case with the wild symbols, as you get 6, 9 or 12 scattered on the reels.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Lastly, for players who want to raid the castle for big winnings without waiting for the features to drop, there is also a Buy option. You can pay $18 to claim 12 in-game free spins and 6 wilds, or $52.50 for 12 free spins and 9 wilds. While you can also pay $131.25 to unleash the maximum 12 free spins and 12 wilds!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p style=\"margin-left:36pt;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">1.

The 5x3 slot is set in medieval China incorporating lanterns, dancing lions and Cai Shen, the God of Wealth. You can bet between $0.25 and $100 per spin on 25 fixed paylines.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You can select the coin value and spin manually, or head to the Auto Spin tab and pre-set a number of spins, loss limit or winnings to reach.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Lanterns & Lions game features</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong> </strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The symbols you’ll be most looking for are the lions, the lanterns and Cai Shen. The Chinese god of wealth is your stacked wild symbol substituting all symbols except the lions and lanterns. Look for them on reels 2 to 5 for massive winnings in the base game.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The lions are your scatter symbol paying 4x your bet. When they land on the first, third and fifth reels, they trigger the two dancing lions.

You´ll need to collect at least five lanterns anywhere to activate this bonus round. The hold & win feature is similar to a respin round with four in-game jackpots up for grabs. The mini jackpot awards winnings of 30x your bet, while the minor prize gives you 100x your bet and the major prize 500x your bet. Last but certainly not least, the grand prize rewards 1,000x your bet!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The in-game free spins are also impressive.

No matter how far you are in your free spin rounds, the lions re-activate your initial number of spins, thus giving you more time to cumulate winnings!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Lastly, any real money spin can trigger a random lucky envelope.

However, should your team let you down, you get your $10 stake back as a free bet.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">This is Betfinal’s Groundhopper and, for the very last hop of the year, we are taking you to a top clash - the Portuguese Clásico! In addition to a risk-free bet available on pre-match and live bets, prep for the game with our betting tips.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Porto in top form</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">FC Porto will be favorite for many reasons. For starters, the Dragons are playing on their turf. They are also the current leaders of the Portuguese league in which they haven’t lost a single match yet. In the first 15 matchdays, Sérgio Conceição’s squad won 13 games and drew 2, while scoring 38 goals and conceding just 8.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">More importantly, Porto crossed paths with Benfica just last week during the Round of 16 of the Taça de Portugal. The Dragons won 3-0 in a very heated and action-packed game. Porto to win seems a sure bet and so will over 2,5 goals.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Benfica up for revenge</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Benfica might have lost the last encounter, but that doesn’t mean they didn’t put on a good fight. The first goal of Evanilson in minute 1 took the defenders by surprise, and so did Ferreira’s goal at minute 7 – okay. But Jorge Jesus’ squad had some fair shots, including Núñez at minute 16 and then Otamendi at minute 82, both annulled by almost imperceptible off-sides. Porto’s goalkeeper, Marchesín, prevailed over all other attempts.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Benfica was also superior when it came to ball possession. And it’s worth noting that they are currently third of the league, having lost just two games, but scoring the most with 46 goals in favor. In fact, both teams count with some of the best scorers in the league. Look for Nuñez and Rafa Silva in Benfica and Evanilson and Luis Díaz on Porto’s side.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Should the Lisbon team fix its defense line, we’d be in for a good fight. Using your risk-free bet on Benfica to win is highly recommended. Odds would provide a good return should they take their revenge, while Betfinal covers your loss up to $10, should Porto prevail.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></p><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Place a $10 bet on the Porto vs Benfica game played December 30<sup>th</sup> at 22:00 CET.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Should you lose your bet, you will get a $10 refund in the form of a free bet.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Cashed out bets and bets placed with bonus funds are not eligible.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Betfinal´s General Terms and Conditions apply.</span></li></ol>",

This jungle-themed game is played on 5 reels and 4 rows. You can bet between $0.10 and $100, by selecting the bet amount and hitting the spin button.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Alternatively, you can go to the auto-play section and choose to automatically play 10 to 1,000 rounds. Or play until you get a win, or until a certain single win amount, balance increase amount or balance decrease amount.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">There are 1,024 ways to win, while the maximum win is up to 45,000x your bet. As you can tell, it’s a high-volatility game, which means that winnings might seem scarce at times, but are massive when they happen!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Silverback Gold also offers a Buy Feature, found on the left side of the reels. There, you can pay 100x your bet to activate in-game free spins instead of waiting for them in the base game.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Silverback Gold game features</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Silverback Gold is filled with cool features to boost your winning potential and fun. The highest paying symbols are evidently the silverback gorilla and the golden silverback gorilla. These can “attack” at random with 6 to 20 gorilla symbols popping out of the jungle and on to the reels.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Sunsets are your wild symbols and wild multipliers of 2x and 3x. These appear on reels 2, 3 and 4 and, when several come up on your payline, your winnings are the product of all multipliers and bet. Wilds also substitute any symbol except for the scatters.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The scatter symbol is a golden medallion with a ruby. Find three or more medallions and you’ll activate a bonus round followed by free spins. Bonus rounds start off with three spins in which your scatters turn into tokens with random values between 1 and 25. The total token value will then add to the collect meter in the free spins rounds.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Three scatters give you 10 free spin rounds, four scatters give you 15 free spins and five scatters reward you with an impressive 20 free spins. That is in the base game. Once free spins are activated, 2, 3, 4 or 5 scatters grant you an additional 3, 10, 15 or 20 free spins respectively.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You keep collecting tokens during free spins rounds as shown in the collect meter under your reels. The symbols are upgraded to a higher paying symbol as you collect tokens. Thus, you generate greater and greater winnings!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p style=\"margin-left:36pt;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">1.

You either cash in a win or get your money back in the form of a $10 free bet!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">To give you even more winning chances, our Liga experts have gathered some useful insights and betting tips.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Cartagena, favorites on their turf</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Luis Carrión’s squad will be the obvious favorite at home, at the Cartagonova Stadium. At the time of writing, the team hasn’t suffered a single defeat in the last six games, including league and Copa del Rey fixtures.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The black and white team from the Murcia community is currently 8<sup>th</sup> on the Segunda División leaderboard, with 10 victories, 3 draws and 9 defeats, 28 goals in favor, and 28 against. This might not sound like quite the dream team but, as mentioned, they are on a lucky streak in both league and cup games.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Meanwhile, the visitors haven’t seen a single victory in their last four games. The team of Xisco Muñoz is down to the 14<sup>th</sup> rank of the leaderboard, with just 6 victories, 9 draws, and 7 losses this season so far.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">This being said, Huesca is, historically speaking, a stronger team. The hard-core Liga fans might remember them in the First Division where they competed in the 2018/19 and 2020/21 seasons, prior to their relegation. You could use your risk-free bet on Huesca to win. The odds will be high, thus bringing you a good return, while you still get your bet refund should they lose.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Over 2,5 goals and top scorers</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The most adventurous punters should consider the Over 2,5 goals bet. We expect Cartagena to score 2 or 3 goals, especially with Alfredo Ortuño and “Berto” Cayarga, their most prolific scorers in the last games. While Huesca should match up to at least 1 goal.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Once again, these are the “risky” bets you might want to consider with a risk-free bet promotion having your back! Be sure to also follow the game live at Betfinal: we will be offering a free live stream and more live stats and odds as the game progresses!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></p><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> To qualify for the Free bet you must lose a $10 bet using real money (not bonus money or free bet token). Cashed-out bets are not eligible.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The minimum stake for this promotion is $10</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The maximum odds for the qualifying bet is 5.00</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The maximum free bet amount is $10</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The refund can only be given for single bets placed on the game Cartagena vs Huesca</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Only the first placed $10 single bet will count towards this promotion</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Betfinal´s General Terms and Conditions apply.</span></li></ol>",

The theme is evidently magic with the main symbol being the sorcerer. It’s made of six reels and four rows and offers 4,096 ways to win. It’s a high volatility game, which means payouts are less frequent but much bigger, totaling up to 5,000x your bet.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">To play the game, start by clicking the “+” button and set the bet lines from 1 to 10, total bet from $0.10 to $100 and coin value which also varies proportionally with the first two settings. Once you’re set, click the spin button or press your space key to start the game. The reels will settle within five seconds to unveil the winning combinations.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Magician’s Secrets game features</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The magic spell to turn your casino coins into big riches requires few components: a spell book, a pendulum, a chalice, a dagger and a potion. These are your highest paying symbols. The wizard himself is the wild symbol. It expands at random to cover an entire reel from reels 2 to 5, thus allowing even more winning combinations. The sorcerer also has the power to substitute any symbol except for the scatter and it comes with a multiplier boost of 2x to 10x your winnings.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">But it might be the crystal ball you’ll be seeking the most. This is your scatter symbol and it magically turns the base game into a free spin mode when three or more land on the reels. What’s even more fun about the in-game free spins is that you first get to choose between free spins with expanding wilds or free spins with sticky wilds.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Should you pick the bonus rounds with expanding wilds, you get 10 free spins. When the sorcerer lands on reels 3 or 4, the symbol expands to cover the entire reel and triggers a respin feature. Multipliers increase with each respin. Lastly, three or more scatters reactivate the 10 bonus rounds.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Should you prefer to play your free spins with sticky wilds, you get 8 bonus rounds. Before you start, a random symbol is selected to turn wild when landing on any reel between the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup>. These newly acquired wild symbols then stick on their position allowing more winning combinations during the remaining free spins. Should you fill up a reel with sticky wilds, you’ll get three additional rounds.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Now, it’s your turn to unveil the Magician’s Secrets with a head start of up to 100 free spins!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p style=\"margin-left:36pt;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">1.

Should the team let you down, you get a full refund in the form of a $10 free bet!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Now, let’s put the odds in your favor and see what are our betting experts’ picks!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Brescia in better form – overall.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">There won’t be a clear favorite at the Oreste Granillo Stadium of Reggio Calabria. The game could go either way, but Brescia to win seems the most likely bet. The team of Filippo Inzaghi has shown a better overall form this season. The visiting team is currently second of the Serie B leaderboard – which means possible promotion to Serie A. That should be enough incentive for the squad to snatch those 3 points.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Brescia is statistically superior with 10 wins, 4 draws and 4 losses so far, and it is also the top scoring team of the Serie B with 30 goals in favor. On the opposite side of the pitch, Reggina is down to the 14<sup>th</sup> rank, with just 6 victories, 5 draws and 7 defeats. More importantly, no win in the last six matchdays.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>So, why aren’t we more confident about Brescia?</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">For starters, Alfredo Aglietti’s team has the home advantage. We also saw them play more actively in their last match against Como. The game ended up in a 1-1 draw after a successful penalty by Cerri, but Reggina had more scoring chances. This game at home could be their moment to really turn things around.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Using your risk-free bet on a draw or Reggina to win could bring a great return. Otherwise, you’ll get your money back!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">When it comes to goals and scorers, our experts are also uncertain. You should keep an eye on Stefano Moreo. Brescia’s number 9 has been one of the most consistent in the squad. But neither team has been scoring much in their last games, so we expect the final score to be under 2.5 goals.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">We sure anticipate many surprises on both sides. So join us this Saturday at 14:00 CET for the live stream, where we will be offering more live stats, betting markets and odds!</span></p><p><br><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> To qualify for the Free bet you must lose a $10 bet using real money (not bonus money or free bet token).

Will you side with the seductive bandit or the rich baron? Let’s find out which one can get you the biggest plunder!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>How to play The Bandit and the Baron</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The western-themed The Bandit and the Baron is a Just For The Win slot released this January in collaboration with Microgaming. It’s a 5x5 video slot with 25 paylines. Its high volatility means that you might need to be patient to hit a big win. But when you do hit, you can win up to 25,000x your bet!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">To play, simply select your stake between $0.20 and $10 by clicking the chip icon and press spin. The reels will take just 5 seconds to stop and automatically highlight the winning combinations. Instead of the main spin button, you can click on the autoplay icon and select 10 to 100 automated spins.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Bandit and the Baron also comes with a Buy Bonus feature, which you can find on the left side of the game grid. This allows you to go straight for the bonus round at the cost of 100x your bet.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>The Bandit and the Baron game features</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong> </strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The game is all about the head-to-head between the female Bandit trying to steal the coins hidden in the Baron’s vault. The baron is your wild symbol. He holds enough influence over this far west town as to expand and fill the reel or substitute all other symbols – all but the bandit of course! In fact, you will never see these two hanging in the same reel.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">While the baron offers more winning combinations in the base game, you will want to side with the bandit, who is your bonus symbol. Should two of the sexy outlaw symbols appear on reels 1, 3 and 5, it will trigger the Bandit Respin. Then, the reels that she has already taken hold of will stay locked, while the rest spins again for additional winnings and chances at getting three bandits.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">When you land three bandits on reels 1, 3 and 5, she takes you to the vault for a bonus round filled with multiplied riches! The bonus round starts off with 12 locked spaces and 13 blank spaces. It consists of just three main symbols: the bandit, the cash and the key. The cash symbols hold values of 1x to 25x which accumulate to be your total plunder at the end of the bonus round. The bandit becomes a cash symbol multiplier, upgrading the cash symbols around her by 2x, 3x, 5x or 10x! The key unlocks the multipliers hidden under the locked spaces.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The bonus round starts with three in-game free spins and a countdown on the right side. But the appearance of any of the three above-mentioned symbols restarts the free spins countdown to 3. The bonus round ends when you reach the countdown reaches zero or when you’ve filled up the entire grid with cash for up to 25,000x your initial bet!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p style=\"margin-left:36pt;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">1.

Derby time, and what a derby are we looking at! Both teams just played in the German Cup and kicked out their first division opponents, Borussia Dortmund and FC Köln, which surely made up for both squads' off start into the new year with a draw each.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">So what are we to expect? This game is nothing less than the decision over the “City Championship” and St Pauli has taken the title home in the most recent games. Their first clash of this season ended in 3-2 in favor of the League Buccaneers.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Hamburg has the best defense of the league though. Tim Walter is under quite some pressure to not lose close contact to the promotion spots on the upper part of the table. And his team is ready to take its revenge. It will be tight, but consider Hamburg our favorite for the win!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Top scorers on both sides</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">While we expect an intense game between both Hamburg squads, once again, the Red Shorts will hold the fort with a strong defense line. If only one can break through, it will be Guido Burgstaller. The St Pauli player from Austria is the Bundesliga 2 top scorer with 14 goals so far.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">On the other side of the pitch, Robert Glatzel is in top form too. Hamburg’s striker scored 10 goals this season so far. He was also the one to defeat Dennis Smarsch in the first derby. Look forward to him scoring again and possibly being key to his team's victory.

While it progressed in the Copa del Rey, the Catalan squad had a shockingly mediocre start in the league and sat in the bottom four for most of the 2021/22 campaign. But from the 13<sup>th</sup> matchday, Michel’s team turned things around and made an impressive “remontada”.</span></p><p><br> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">This January, Girona was kick out of the Copa del Rey when losing the Round of 16 battle against Michel’s former team, Rayo Vallecano. Same round that saw Atlético Madrid, Sevilla and Barcelona eliminated by the underdogs. More importantly though, Girona hasn´t lost a single league game in the last six matchdays and is now holding on tight to its position in the top 6. </span></p><p><br> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Last season’s losing playoff finalists, Girona will fight for its chance to play the promotion play-offs and return to First Division. The visitors’ team will be our favorites to win. Even more so, because Amorebieta has only won three games this season and currently sits in the bottom four of the leaderboard.</span></p><p><br> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> Pichichi potential</span></p><p><br> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Amorebieta is brand new to the Second Division. They were promoted last season and are competing in the Second Division for the first time in the club’s history. And the experience has been tough on Iñigo Vélez’s team who, as mentioned above, only won three games this season. </span></p><p><br> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">But do not let statistics fool you either, the Basques are stubborn and very hard to beat actually! The squad managed to draw half of its games, while Mikel Saizar held the fort, and they have accustomed us to 1-1 scores.</span></p><p><br> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">However, Girona has one major ace up its sleeve and his name is Cristhian Stuani. The captain from Uruguay has score 15 goals this season and is on track for the Pichichi trophy. Expect him to break through the Basque defense and lead his team to victory with a total score over 2,5 goals – dare we say a possible 1-2 final score!</span></p><p><br><br> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">To claim the Free bet, simply make a $10 deposit and select the Bonus from the available Bonus dropdown menu</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Free bet amount is $10</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Free bet is valid for any single bet on the game SD Amorebieta vs Girona.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The qualifying deposit needs to be wagered at least once with min odds of 1.90 or 1.60 per selection in combination bets.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Free bet can only be claimed once per person/address/IP/device.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Any Free bet winnings will be credited to the player's account as cash and can be paid out without any further wagering requirements.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Betfinal´s General Terms and Conditions apply.</span></li></ol>",

The reels will settle within five seconds to unveil the winning combinations.</span></p><p><br> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Gold Party game features</strong></span></p><p><br> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Your highest paying symbols in the base game are the unicorn, horseshoe, mushroom-house and harp, which all start paying up when you land three or more aligned from left to right. But the highest paying of all is the Leprechaun symbol. When this legendary creature stacks up on reel one, the reel is copied on one or more additional reels, thus increasing winning combinations.</span></p><p><br> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Gold Three is your Wild symbol and it can only land on reels 2, 3 and 4. It substitutes all other symbols except for the Money symbol, the pot o’ gold. Talking of which, there are two types of Money symbols: regular with one pot o’ gold or Double Money with two pots o’ gold, which counts as two regular Money symbols in the base game.</span></p><p><br> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">More importantly, should you land six or more Money symbols, you’ll trigger the highly rewarding Respin feature. The Respin rounds start off with eight spins and are played on four 3x5 grids, each linked to one of four jackpots. In the Respin rounds, you’ll only have three symbols to worry about: the Money (pot o’ gold), the Multiplier (a purple-hair fairy) and the Extra Spin (a coin over a rainbow). These symbols stick to their position until the end of the bonus round. </span></p><p><br> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">While you keep on getting respins when landing the Extra Spin symbol, bonus rounds eventually end when you run out of respins, reach the maximum winning of 5,163x your bet or when you’ve filled all the grids with symbols. That´s when it gets really rewarding as each grid you complete unlocks a jackpot! As mentioned earlier, there are four jackpots: Mini pays 20x your bet, Minor 50x your bet, Major 200x your bet and Grand 5,000x your bet! Once the Respin round completed, you winnings are the total value of paying symbols, multipliers and jackpots!</span></p><p><br> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></p><p><br> </p><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You get 15 free spins when depositing $25-49.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You get 40 free spins when depositing $50-99.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You claim the maximum 100 free spins when depositing at least $100.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Your free spins are valid for the game Gold Party by Pragmatic Play.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Winnings generated by free spins must be wagered 35x.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Free spins are valid from Wednesday 2nd to Sunday 6th of February and must be wagered within 15 days upon activation. </span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Betfinal´s General Terms and Conditions apply.</span></li></ol>",

The 30 years-old player has been in amazing form this season. But following disagreement over his contract, he started showing interest in changing team. Thus attracting various bids, the most persistent being from QPR. And while this strange saga ended in Paterson ultimately staying with the Swans, one could wonder whether Paterson will keep being his team’s best player or drag the mood down behind the scenes.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">On the other side of the pitch, keep an eye on young Rover, Ben Brereton Díaz. The 22 years-old striker is not to be underestimated, as he is one of the top scorers of this Championship season so far with 20 goals.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></p><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">To claim the Free bet, simply make a $10 deposit and select the Bonus from the available Bonus dropdown menu.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Free bet amount is $10.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Free bet is valid for any single bet on the game Swansea City vs Blackburn Rovers.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The qualifying deposit needs to be wagered at least once with min odds of 1.90 or 1.60 per selection in combination bets.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Free bet can only be claimed once per person/address/IP/device.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Any Free bet winnings will be credited to the player's account as cash and can be paid out without any further wagering requirements.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Betfinal´s General Terms and Conditions apply.</span></li></ol>",

As always, your free bet is available for live betting too and we offer plenty more betting opportunities as well as the livestream broadcast during the match!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Now let’s find out what our <i>Calcio</i> experts have to say about the game…</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Lecce, favorites in their den</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Despite an off start to the 2021/22 season, Lecce has rapidly climbed to the top of the Serie B leaderboard. In the last matchday, the Wolves of Apulia even snatched the first rank off Pisa, which had held the position for most of the season. Now the squad of Marco Baroni are looking to secure their position, distance their fierce rivals from Pisa and Bescia and, ultimately, return to Serie A. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Lecce is in top form and will be the obvious favorites to win at home, in the Stadio Via del Mare. Fun fact though, the last three Lecce vs Benevento encounters since 2018 all resulted in a tie. But this match should definitely break the spell. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Talking of which, the Sorcerers and former champions of the 2019/2020 season have had a fairly regular season, defending their play-off position. However, they failed to score any victory in the last three matchdays. Can Caserta surprise us all and turn things around in Lecce? </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Young talents to score</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Lecce is also top of the league when it comes to goals with 35 in favor and just 18 against. Expect Coda to be onto Benevento’s goalkeeper, assisted by young midfielder, Strefezza. Look also for fairly unknown, Listkowski. Acquired from the Polish Ekstraklasa league in 2020, the 23 years-old has shown promising performances in the last games with Lecce. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">On the other side of the pitch, we would expect Moncini and Lapadula to create the strongest attacks on the home team. Note, however, that Caserta has left the Peruvian national out on the last games, despite the fact that he is currently the top scorer of the league. If Lapadula does come in, he knows well the team of Lecce where he played while on loan from Genoa in 2019/20.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Be sure to also check our Combo Markets; you’ll find interesting fast combinations for greater odds. One such is “Both teams to score and Over 2.5 goals” at 2.20, or a more secure “Lecce to win and Over 1.50 goals” at 2.40.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">To claim the free bet, simply make a $10 deposit and select the bonus from the dropdown menu available in the Cashier section.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free bet amount is $10.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free bet is valid for any single bet on the game Lecce vs Benevento.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The qualifying deposit needs to be wagered at least once with min odds of 1.90 or 1.60 per selection in combination bets. </span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free bet can only be claimed once per person/address/IP/device.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Any free bet winnings will be credited to the player's account as cash and can be paid out without any further wagering requirements.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Betfinal´s General Terms and Conditions apply.</span></li></ol>",

It plays on a grid of 5 reels and 4 rows. There are 1,024 paylines or ways to win, and the winning combinations land from left to right. It´s a high volatility slot, where you can win up to 10,000x your bet. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You can bet as little as $0.20 and all the way to $25 per spin. To play simply press the chip icon at the lower left corner of the grid and select your stake. Press the + icon to play in auto-spin or fast spin, or simply press the spin button to start the reels.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Wolf Call game features</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Fitting its North American nature theme, the highest paying symbols are a wolf, a bear, an eagle, a stag and a cougar. However, it's the howling wolf you’ll be seeking the most as this is your Bonus symbol. Land 3, 4 or 5 of these, and you’ll immediately be rewarded with 10, 15 or 20 in-game free spins. Note that Wolf Call offers a buy feature, where you can purchase 10 in-game free spins for the cost of 50x your bet. This way you enter the bonus game without waiting for the symbols to align.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">When entering the Wolf Call slot, you will also instantly notice a Power Range laying on the center of your grid. The Wild diamonds landing on this Power Range award extra multipliers to boost your winnings by 2x! When in free spins mode, the Power Range takes over the entire grid while diamonds award multipliers of 2x again, but also 3x and up to 5x!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Wild diamonds have another important purpose. Every Wild you land goes straight to increasing the Diamond Meter on top of your game grid. Evidently, if a Wild lands within the Power Range, it contributes twice as much to the Diamond Meter. Once you fill up the Diamond Meter, you access the jackpot feature.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">There are four jackpots up for grabs. They are located on top of the game window and come in four colors: yellow, red, purple and green. To win one of these four jackpots, you will need to collect at least 3 diamonds of the corresponding color!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Now that you know what to expect in the wild, claim up to 100 free spins to discover Wolf Call!</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></p><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You get 15 free spins when depositing $25-49.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You get 40 free spins when depositing $50-99.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You claim the maximum 100 free spins when depositing at least $100.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Your free spins are valid for the game Wolf Call by Microgaming.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Winnings generated by free spins must be wagered 35x.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Free spins are valid and must be wagered within 15 days upon activation. </span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Betfinal´s General Terms and Conditions apply.</span></li></ol>",

You can then use your free bet for pre-match or live bets. In fact, we will be offering the livestream and additional betting opportunities while the action unfolds.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Warm up today and read our Calcio experts’ insights and betting tips…</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Juventus, favorite of the Derby della Mole</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Derby della Mole is Turin’s iconic clash between Juventus and Torino. And Juve has won them all but one in the past decade and more. They are the obvious favorites at odds of 1.64 to win. The black and whites are also in better form, having suffered no loss in the last five matchdays while earning their spot in the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Allegri’s squad currently holds the fourth rank of the Serie A leaderboard despite a pretty off start of the season. Expect them to fight for these 3 points that will keep them in the top 4 for a direct qualification to the Champions.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Torino, on the other hand, arrives to the derby after two consecutive defeats, against Udinese and Venezia surprisingly. We hardly expect a surprise from the team of Ivan Jurić, so let’s look into goals and players!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Best betting markets for Juventus vs Torino</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">With Juve favorite, we would expect at least two goals from them, maybe one from the Bulls saving the honor. Exact scores of 2-0 or 2-1 would pay with odds of 6.50 and 7.50 respectively. Alternatively, Betfinal gives odds of 1.99 for over 2.5 goals.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">See also our Combo Markets tab, for fast combined bets with better odds. For instance Juve to win with over 1.5 goals pays 1.96x your bet, while the riskier Juve to win with over 2.5 goals pays 2.59x. The Derby della Molle is famously the most one-sided derby in Italy, so be sure to check our Asian Handicaps to spice things up. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">When it comes to goal scorers, the Old Lady has plenty of striking force. However, the most constant scorers in Juve are Vlahovic (2.08), Morata (2.30) and Dybala (2.35). </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Take advantage of your $10 free bet to see our wide selection of bets and markets for this Serie A derby while you watch the game live right here, at Betfinal sports!</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></p><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">To claim the Free bet, simply make a $10 deposit and select the Bonus from the available Bonus dropdown menu.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Free bet amount is $10.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Free bet is valid for any single bet on the game Juventus vs Torino.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The qualifying deposit needs to be wagered at least once with min odds of 1.90 or 1.60 per selection in combination bets.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Free bet can only be claimed once per person/address/IP/device.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Any Free bet winnings will be credited to the player's account as cash and can be paid out without any further wagering requirements.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Betfinal´s General Terms and Conditions apply.</span></li></ol>",

The reels will settle and highlight the winning combinations in less than 4 seconds. You can also go for fast spins or auto-play with 10 to 1,000 spins.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Hotline 2 slot also comes with a Buy feature.

The base game consists of 5 reels and 3 rows. However, your rows can expand when collecting Wild symbols, turning your game into a thrilling car chase.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The main feature is the Hotline. It’s a bonus bet that boosts your chances at winning Expanding Wild symbols. In the base game, the Hotline only appears in reel 3. However, when the double or triple bets are activated, reels 3 and 4, or 2, 3 and 4 respectively, become the Hotlines. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">So what’s with the Wilds? Represented by a car chase, these only appear on reels 2, 3 or 4 and replace all other symbols but the Scatter. More importantly, the Wilds expand to the entire reel and beyond when they land on the Hotline. Your symbols then turn into a car chase filled with big wins!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You’ll also chase the Scatters symbols, represented by vintage neon signs. When you land three of them on reels 2, 3 or 4, you get seven in-game free spins! In these bonus rounds, the Wild symbols increase the reels height to allow even more winning combinations. In fact, if the base game offers 243 ways to win, it quickly increases to 1,944x in free spin rounds!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Buckle up with up to 100 free spins and discover all these features for yourself on the Hotline 2 slot!</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></p><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You get 15 free spins when depositing $25-49.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You get 40 free spins when depositing $50-99.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You claim the maximum 100 free spins when depositing at least $100.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Your free spins are valid for the game Hotline 2 by NetEnt.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Winnings generated by free spins must be wagered 35x.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Free spins are valid and must be wagered within 15 days upon activation. </span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Betfinal´s General Terms and Conditions apply.</span></li></ol>",

You can then use your free bet for any pre-match or live bet on Hamburger vs Werder. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You can also watch the game with us: we will be livestreaming the event as the action unfolds and new live betting opportunities arise! For now, be sure to warm up with the betting tips and insights of our Bundesliga experts. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Hamburger to win, but it’s going to be tricky!</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Nordderby opposes the two Northern German clubs of Hamburger SV and Werder Bremen for now close to 100 years. Of all 155 encounters, Werder is the team with the most victories – 58 wins since 1927.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">However, their very last meeting in September saw Hamburger come out victorious from its visit to the Weserstadion, beating the home team by 0-2. While this Sunday game is played at the Volksparkstadion and Hamburger now gets the home advantage, can Werder claim their revenge? </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Werder is currently leading the Bundesliga 2 leaderboard, while Hamburger is close second with just one point between them. For reminder, the Bundesliga 2 offers two places for direct promotion to first division; the third place gets to qualify via the play-offs. And the competition is rough this season! Darmstadt, St Pauli and Schalke are right behind with just 2 points between Werder and Schalke on the fifth rank.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">So there is a lot to win for each squad by claiming these 3 points in the Volksparkstadion. And both are in great shape: Werder is undefeated for the past nine games, while Hamburger has only been defeated twice this season. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">When it’s all said and done, should you use your free bet on the 1X2 market, we recommend to go with Hamburger to win.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Striking potential on both sides</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">We expect goals and goals – somewhere over 2.5 goals to be precise. So, who’s to score? Our top contender is 28 years old striker Robert Glatzel. In Hamburger since just 2021, the German player is already up 14 goals this season and he is the most constant in Tim Alter’s team. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Check also Sonny Kittel. The 29 years old midfielder has been Hamburger’s top scorer and even savior in the last two games. Kittel was the man to score twice in the 2-0 victory against Heidenheim, and he was he again who equalized the score against Sandhausen.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">On the other side of the pitch, Marvin Ducksch is one the top scorers in the Bundesliga 2 with 13 goals this season. The German striker joined Werder in 2021 but he is the most constant. He scored at least one goal in all last five games except against Ingolstadt. Ducksch to score is a fairly sure bet.</span><br><br> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></p><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">To claim the Free bet, simply make a $10 deposit and select the Bonus from the available Bonus dropdown menu.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Free bet amount is $10.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Free bet is valid for any single bet on the game Hamburger vs Werder.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The qualifying deposit needs to be wagered at least once with min odds of 1.90 or 1.60 per selection in combination bets.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Free bet can only be claimed once per person/address/IP/device.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Any Free bet winnings will be credited to the player's account as cash and can be paid out without any further wagering requirements.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Betfinal´s General Terms and Conditions apply.</span></li></ol>",

It’s a 5x5 grid but symbols come out from the bottom left and fill the spaces in a circular motion. The graphics are stunning and features are plenty and truly original!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You can bet from $0.10 and up to $200 by adjusting the coin value located on the right side of the game. Spin from the main, middle button, or chose the auto-play option. The latter automates up to 1,000 spins while you seat back and watch the winnings roll your way!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Finn and the Swirly Spin game features</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Finn and the Swirly Spin takes you to a magical Irish countryside, where Finn the Leprechaun plays the flute while you chase the winning combinations. The game has a very original layout in swirl shape and is packed with amazing features that will boost your winnings. Let’s dig in!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">It all start with the Free Spins Key. The key is always at the bottom left of the reels. As you spin and win, it moves forward in the swirl until reaching the center of the game. In-game free spins activate when the Key reaches the center and all other symbols have paid out and avalanched off the grid. However, if you do not get a winning spin, the Key returns to the bottom left corner.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Wins occur very simply when at least three of the same symbols are adjacent vertically or horizontally. Once a win is paid out, the winning symbols explode out of your grid, remaining symbols avalanche into the empty spots and new combinations appear. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">To boost your combinations, you will be looking for the cute Star. This is your Wild symbol and it substitutes all other symbols except for the Key Free Spin. Symbols from winning combinations created by the Star explode to leave room for new combinations. How? New Stars pop in the middle of winning matches while the remaining symbols avalanche into the empty spaces.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Random features and in-game free spins</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">In the base game, there are four Random Features to take your winnings to the next level. First, we have the Starfall Wild, which shoots new Wilds at random into your reels. The Dragon destroys a random number of symbols to activate avalanches and make room for new winning opportunities. The Irish Luck, represented by a mug of beer, can add full lines of symbols thus guaranteeing winnings. Lastly, the magical cauldron “Magic Transform” transforms your spades and hearts into higher-paying symbols thus boosting your winnings.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">When awarded a free spin round, you get to choose which Random Free Spin Features you’d like to play your spins with. There are four, similar to the Random Features from the base game: Star Bar Free Spins add wilds. Lava Lair Free Spins destroy symbols and activate the avalanche. Lucky Mug Free Spins add lines of symbols for guaranteed wins. And Golden Pot Free Spins upgrade your spades and hearts into higher-paying symbols.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></p><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You get 15 free spins when depositing $25-49.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You get 40 free spins when depositing $50-99.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You claim the maximum 100 free spins when depositing at least $100.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Your free spins are valid for the game Finn and the Swirly Spin by NetEnt.

They only lost three games since the kick-off of the 2021/22 campaign and have already insured their spot in the next European championships. They lead with an advantage of 6 points over their closest rival in Liverpool.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">On the other side, Manchester United will need to keep collecting victories to insure their qualification to the next Champions League. Losing this game, might let West Ham or Arsenal take over the fourth rank of the leaderboard. The stakes are higher for the Red Devils, but we doubt they’ll beat the solid line up of Guardiola.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Consider our handicap bets to balance the odds. Man.City to win with a handicap of just -1.75 would increase odds from 1.40 to 2.37, should you want to go with the home team.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Goals and Players</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">One of Guardiola´s main advantage is a top defense and goalkeeper. Ederson often ends the games with a clean sheet – 15 times to be precise. It will tough for United to go through him. Nevertheless, look forward to Portuguese devils Fernandes (4.75) and Ronaldo (3.00) to be onto him. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The best scoring chance on the citizens’ side might well be Raheem Sterling (2.37). The English sportsman has been in top form this season and has recently been crown Premier League Player of the Month last December. He has scored 10 goals this season only and is also one of the best to assist goals.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Now when it’s all said and done, the Manchester Derby is always action-packed and we can only recommend you watch it live, right here in our live betting platform with livestream. We will offer more betting opportunities as the action unfold too!</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></p><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">To claim the free bet, simply make a $10 deposit and select the bonus from the available bonus dropdown menu.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free bet amount is $10.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free bet is valid for any single bet on the game Manchester City vs Manchester United.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The qualifying deposit needs to be wagered at least once with min odds of 1.90 or 1.60 per selection in combination bets.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free bet can only be claimed once per person/address/IP/device.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Any free bet winnings will be credited to the player's account as cash and can be paid out without any further wagering requirements.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Betfinal´s General Terms and Conditions apply.</span></li></ol>",

They crawl over the reels until randomly replacing symbols with the Snake Wild symbol thus allowing winnings of over 2,000x your bet!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Book of Souls itself is your Scatter Wild symbol, which substitutes all other symbols to create more winning combinations. Should you land at least three Books of Souls, you will activate 10 in-game free spins.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free spin round start by picking one symbol, which will become the Expanding Special Symbol during the bonus round. This symbol can expand and fill up your reels allowing wins of well over 10,000x your initial bet! </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You can keep on landing three or more Books of Souls during the bonus round. And just like in the base game, this triggers and adds 10 more free spins. There is no limit on how many bonus spins you can get. So, you may be stuck a while inside the Inca temple while your winnings increase!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Once you’ve achieved some winnings, Book of Souls Remastered offers two additional features to gamble and increase these winnings. These are the Ladder and Card gamble. While you can double your wins, be aware that you can also lose it all! And isn´t it the exciting part of it all?!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Should you want to play it safe, Book of Souls Remastered also offers three features to assist you. First, the Superstake, which doubles your chances to trigger the in-game free spins for the cost of 2.50x your bet. You’ve got also the Buy Snake Spin for the cost of 30x your bet, which increase your chances of triggering the Snake Wilds. Lastly, the Buy Into Bonus for 200x your bet, takes you straight to the bonus round.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></p><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You get 15 free spins when depositing $25-49.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You get 40 free spins when depositing $50-99.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You claim the maximum 100 free spins when depositing at least $100.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Your free spins are valid for the game Book of Souls Remastered by Spearhead.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Winnings generated by free spins must be wagered 35x.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Free spins are valid and must be wagered within 15 days upon activation. </span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Betfinal´s General Terms and Conditions apply.</span></li></ol>",

  "html-88": "<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Join us this Saturday at 13:00 UTC for a $10 free bet for Lecce vs Brescia. Stay for live bets with livestream of the game!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Groundhopper takes you to the South of Italy for a tense clash at the top of the Serie B leaderboard. As always, be sure to deposit at least $10 before the kick-off to claim your free bet. Your free bet is then available on a wide range of bets, except systems and Asian handicaps. However, your winnings are wager-free!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">So, what’s at stake and what are the sure bets you can place with your $10 free bet?</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Lecce in top form</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Lecce leads the Serie B table and has been during few matchdays. However, the competition for the top is rough in the Serie B! The Wolves from Puglia have now 53 points. Not enough to keep Cremonese (53 points), Pisa (52 points) and Brescia (51 points) off the top position. For reminder, the Serie B offers two positions for promotion to Serie A, two more for qualification through the semi-final playoffs and another four for playoffs from the preliminary rounds. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Pisa and Cremonese will be facing off on Sunday, while Pisa is receiving Brescia. Both clashes will be very balanced as each team fights to remain in the top 4. However, Pisa takes a slight advantage by playing home at the Stadio Via del Mare. Baroni’s squad is also the one in best form, having suffered no loss in its last three games.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Goal bonanza?</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Lecce is the Serie B team with the most scoring potential. The home team is up 46 goals this season and counts with top scorer, Coda, and Strefezza. Check our Players betting tab and you’ll find these two up top with odds of 2.06 and 2.80 respectively. Coda should be a pretty sure bet, considering that the Italian striker has scored in all last six games.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Brescia shouldn’t be underestimated either. The Lioness is one of the highest scoring teams this season. 43 goals overall, but they barely ever leave a clean sheet. Expect the likes of Aye Florian (3.15) or Bianchi (3.40) to get through Lecce’s keepers, Bleve or Gabriel. With that in mind, consider also our Scores best – a 2:1 win for Lecce pays off 8.00x. A 1:1 draw at 5.50 odds could also happen, considering both teams history for draws - 2:2 last season and 1:1 this season in 2021.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Now, with all this in mind, deposit at least $10 before Saturday at 13:00 UTC to be sure that your free bet is ready for the live game!</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">To claim the free bet, simply make a $10 deposit and select the bonus from the available bonus dropdown menu.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free bet amount is $10.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free bet is valid for any single bet on the game Lecce vs Brescia.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The qualifying deposit needs to be wagered at least once with min odds of 1.90 or 1.60 per selection in combination bets.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free bet can only be claimed once per person/address/IP/device.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Any free bet winnings will be credited to the player's account as cash and can be paid out without any further wagering requirements.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Betfinal´s General Terms and Conditions apply.</span></li></ol>",

In fact, the Meringues are the absolute favorites to lift the trophy at the end of the season. They will be playing with confidence in their turf, at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium. More importantly, Ancelotti’s team arrives to this game after four league victories in a row and after eliminating PSG in Champions League.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>The best Classic in years is ahead of us.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Blaugrana will travel to the Spanish capital in search of the first win over their rivals since March 2019. Are you ready for the big day when the two football titans will face each other once again in El Clásico of the Spanish League on 20.03.22? Who will win? Who will suffer defeat? Or maybe points will be shared?  </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Both teams have shown magnificent results in their recent performances in the Spanish Primera Liga - with four wins and one draw in the last five games. It will be the second league encounter of the season between Barcelona and Real Madrid, with the Blaugrana having hosted their eternal competitors in October. The Catalan side will be keen on taking revenge on Madrid after losing that encounter 2-1 at Camp Nou.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Barcelona has begun to resemble its old self.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Barcelona have regained their character, and this is reflected in their results. Yes, the battle for the championship is probably closed, but a possible victory for the visitors at the Santiago Bernabeu could have worked for the Blaugrana like blood on a shark. Is the triumph of the visitors in Sunday's El Clásico possible? Absolutely, and Real Madrid are fully aware of this.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Carlos Ancelotti's team remain the leader in the La Liga table with 66 points. Barcelona are in third place, but their loss is already 15 points. Nevertheless, in La Liga, Barca under Xavi lost only to Betis 0:1. This situation occurred in December last year. Since then, the Pride of Catalonia has not recorded a defeat. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Real Madrid - Last 5 HOME games:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Real Madrid    3-1    PSG</span><br><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Real Madrid    4-1    Real Sociedad</span><br><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Real Madrid    3-0    Deportivo Alaves</span><br><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Real Madrid    1-0     Granada CF</span><br><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Real Madrid    2-2     Elche CF</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Barcelona - Last 5 AWAY games:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Elche CF                  1-2      Barcelona   </span><br><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Napoli                     2-4     Barcelona</span><br><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Valencia CF             1-4     Barcelona</span><br><span style=\"color:#000000;\">RCD Espanyol         2-2     Barcelona</span><br><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Deportivo Alaves    0-1     Barcelona</span></p><p><br><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></p><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">To claim the free bet, simply make a $10 deposit and select the bonus from the available bonus dropdown menu.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free bet amount is $10.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free bet is valid for any single bet on the game Real Madrid vs Barcelona.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The qualifying deposit needs to be wagered at least once with min odds of 1.90 or 1.60 per selection in combination bets.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free bet can only be claimed once per person/address/IP/device.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Any free bet winnings will be credited to the player's account as cash and can be paid out without any further wagering requirements.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Betfinal´s General Terms and Conditions apply.</span></li></ol>",

Rubi’s team, now second behind Eibar, could easily claim this home victory and keep close to the current leaders. On the other side, Girona is currently fifth, tightly in points between Tenerife and Ponferradina. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">For reminder, the first two of the Second Division snatch direct promotions for La Liga, while ranks 3-6 will play the play-offs to qualify to the upper division. Should Girona lose this game, the squad would merely fall to the 6<sup>th</sup> place, keeping the next teams still at bay.</span></p><h2><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Almeria to win, Girona to score</strong></span></h2><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The home team is the clear favorite this Sunday with odds of 1.98 to win against 3.60 for Girona. UD Almeria has only lost eight games this season and has shown great form by doing everything it takes to stay in the top 2. However, Rubi’s team arrives to this game after one tough victory against Tenerife, a draw against Lugo and a big defeat against Zaragoza.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">And, while they might not be favorites on Sunday, Girona might seem more promising. First off, the Catalan team just won its last three games. It is also one of the team with most goals. And of their 49 goals total, 17 scored by Pichichi potential, Stuani. Keep an eye on the Uruguayan striker on Sunday.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">With this in mind, you should quite a few goals. Over 1.75 would pay 1.40x your stake, while Over 2.75 would raise it to 2.34x your stake and both teams to score 1.84x. Be sure to also check our Combo Markets for fast combinations at increased odds.</span></p><p> </p><h2><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></h2><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">To claim the free bet, simply make a $10 deposit and select the bonus from the available bonus dropdown menu.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free bet amount is $10.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free bet is valid for any single bet on the game Almeria vs Girona.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The qualifying deposit needs to be wagered at least once with min odds of 1.90 or 1.60 per selection in combination bets.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free bet can only be claimed once per person/address/IP/device.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Any free bet winnings will be credited to the player's account as cash and can be paid out without any further wagering requirements.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Betfinal´s General Terms and Conditions apply.</span></li></ol>",

The game grid is made of five reels and four rows and 30 paylines. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You can bet between $0.10 and $100 per spin. Simply select the stake amount by playing with the “-“ and “+” buttons. Then click the spin button to start the game. You can also click on Auto-spin to let the reels spin until you click again.

The Wild lion substitutes all symbols except for the Scatter and Bonus symbols. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Scatter is represented by a Marula tree. Landing three or more Scatters will activate eight in-game free spins. These are very similar to the base game but with a boosted Wild symbol. Indeed, the Wild becomes Wild x2 and doubles the wins of all the paylines that include it. Furthermore, landing three or more Wild x2 during free spin rounds triggers an additional eight free spins.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The last base game symbol to look for is a diamond. This is your Bonus symbol and landing six or more will trigger the bonus game. The bonus game just fills up with diamonds and your winnings are as indicated by each diamond, 1x to 16x your bet! </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">There are even more valuable gems in the bonus game. While in the base game, you will notice four in-game jackpots on top of the reels: Grand, Major, Minor and Mini. You can win these in the bonus game while collecting the right precious stones. The amethyst gemstone will trigger the Mini jackpot, while emeralds trigger the Minor jackpot and rubies the Major jackpot. To claim the Grand jackpot, you will need to fill the reels with diamonds. </span></p><p> </p><h2><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></h2><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You get 15 free spins when depositing $25-49.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You get 40 free spins when depositing $50-99.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You claim the maximum 100 free spins when depositing at least $100.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Your free spins are valid for the game Lion Gems: Hold and Win by Playson.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Winnings generated by free spins must be wagered 35x.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Free spins are valid and must be wagered within 15 days upon activation. </span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Betfinal´s General Terms and Conditions apply.</span></li></ol><p><br> </p>",

Juventus and Internazionale have already met twice this season. Inter claim the win 2-1 in the Super Cup match. However, their first league encounter concluded in a draw 1-1. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">However, Juventus comes in strong this Sunday, following four league victories in a row. They will also have the home advantage at the Allianz Stadium. On the other end, Inter had a better form through the season. The squad only lost but three games this season and made sure to remain in the Top 3 for all of it. Simone Inzaghi’s team arrives in Turin after a loss, draw, win and two draws in the last five matchdays.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">For reminder, the Serie A offers four positions of qualification to the champions, while the fifth and sixth of the leaderboard only get to Europa League. Both Inter and Juve, currently third and fourth respectively, wouldn´t lose the Top 4 after a loss in Turin. But the winner would stay in the race for the lead with Milan and Napoli, currently first and second.</span></p><h2><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Who’s to score?</strong></span></h2><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Inter is the Serie A team with most goals in favor with 62 in total. And we hope for goals bonanza this Sunday too. On Inter Milan´s side, look for Martínez and Džeko to be on to Juve goalkeeper, Szczęsny.

So make the best of your free bet and keep reading to see what our EPL experts have to say about this clash of titans!</span></p><h2><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>What’s at stake?</strong></span></h2><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Manchester City and Liverpool are dominating the English Premier League with an iron fist. They are respectively first and second with 73 and 72 points, well above Chelsea, third with just 59 points. That’s to say that both squads are in top form this season and will be fighting for the EPL title.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">So, the win at the Eithad Stadium is important for both teams to keep their rivals at bay and be a step closer to the 2021/22 trophy. For reminder, their first encounter this season ended in a draw 2-2 at the Anfield. The Citizens will now have the advantage of playing at home and are given favorites by most bookies including ours. </span></p><h2><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Can Liverpool surprise the bookies?</strong></span></h2><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Klopp’s team might not be favorite, but they have been unbeaten for the last 11 matchdays. In the last league games, they have shown a better form than Guardiola’s men. The Reds are also in the Champions League quarterfinals and the FA Cup semi-finals… against Manchester City once again! Whatever happens this weekend, Man. City and Liverpool will face off again on Saturday 16<sup>th</sup> to decide of the FA Cup finalist. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Another interesting stat about Liverpool: the team has the highest goals scored by far – 77 goals this season so far. Salah, Jota and Mané are totaling 56 goals, while the Citizens top scorers, De Bruyne, Mahrez and Sterling only got 10 goals each. Trent Alexander-Arnold, Robertson and Salah again are on top of the EPL stats when it comes to assists. That goes to show that the Reds are working as a well-oiled machine this season.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The biggest challenge for all these top-class strikers will be the Brazilian goalkeepers, Alisson on Liverpool’s side and Ederson on City’s side, who are also the best performing in this EPL season.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">When it’s all said and done, we expect a very exciting game, action-packed from both side of the pitch and in the stands.

It´s a 5x3 game grid with just five straight paylines, paying from left to right. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You can bet as little as $0.05 per spin and up to $100.

Land five or more and you’ll be awarded three respins.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">While in the respin rounds, you can earn more respins by landing more Royal Crown symbols. In fact, these are the only symbols present in the bonus game. The crowns have a defined value which are summed up to your total winning at the end of the respins. The bonus game ended when you run out of respins or when you fill the entire grid with crowns.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The highest values you can win during the bonus games are the five jackpots that you will have noticed on the left side of your game grid. The Big Jackpot rewards you 100x your bet, while the Mega pays off 200x, the Monster 400x and the Legendary 1,000x your bet. But it´s the Super jackpot you will be hoping for as this pays 3,000x your bet!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">As it is often the case in Spearhead games, the bonus round includes two features: Card Gamble and Gamble Ladder. Both allow you to gamble your winnings to double its value!

Not only because the game is played in the Parc des Princes, but PSG is a top squad in top form. The team now counts with some of the very best players around the globe. This might not be enough in European championships yet, but it is in the Ligue 1 where they have dominated for most of the season. By now, they lead with a 12-point advantage on Marseille.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">We also expect Neymar, Messi and above all Mbappé to score. The young French sportsman is in fact the top scorer of the French league with 20 goals. And this striking trio has been hell to their last opponents, such as 1-6 in Clermont or 5-1 against Lorient. We are hoping for plenty of goals again, but…</span></p><h2><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>OM, up for the challenge</strong></span></h2><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Olympique Marseille is PSG main rival. In fact, this is considered the French Classic and the rivalry goes beyond the pitch. The squad of Sampaoli are up for the challenge and, in the first leg at the Stade Vélodrome, they did not let the PSG strikers through, ending the game in a 0-0 draw.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Now, OM arrives in Paris following four big victories in a row – that´s more than PSG can say. Their striking force might not match the Parisians, as Marseille relies a lot on the performance of its captain, Payet – and also but less, Bamba Dieng and Amine Harit.

  "html-108": "<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The players of Betfinal Casino have spoken and chose Gates of Olympus as their favorite slot this month. So, here is a Game of the Week that should make many of you happy. But if you do not know it yet, this is your chance to try it with a bonus boost:</span></p><ul><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Deposit $25-49 to claim 15 free spins,</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Or deposit $50-99 to claim 40 free spins,</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Or deposit at least $100 to claim the maximum 100 free spins.</span></li></ul><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Gates of Olympus is fairly simple in terms of game mechanics, which is actually part of its charm. While keeping things simple, the slot also offers all the favorite features online players look for. Let us tell you more…</span></p><h2><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>How to play the Gates of Olympus slot</strong></span></h2><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Gates of Olympus is a Pragmatic Play slot. It consists of six reels, five rows and the unique “win-all-ways” mechanic, which means that symbols pay anywhere they land! In fact, Gates of Olympus is a highly rewarding slot with a winning potential of 5,000x your bet!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You can bet from $0.20 and up to $100 per spin. To choose your preferred bet value, click on the “+” and “-“ buttons. You then start the game by clicking the spin button or the space key of your keyboard. Instead of spinning reels, the symbols cascade or fall on and off the game grid. Winning combinations will be highlighted before exploding and being replaced by new cascading symbols.</span></p><h2><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Gates of Olympus game features</strong></span></h2><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Gates of Olympus, as its name suggests, is set on top of Mount Olympus. You might not meet all the Greek gods, but Zeus will remain on the right side of your game grid, ready to strike your gaming session with lightening and high rewards.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The highest paying symbols are jewels and gems and you will need to land eight or more on any position to start seeing godly wins. But it is Zeus himself that you will seek the most. The king of Olympus is your Scatter and your most rewarding symbol, as just four pay off, while landing six pay 200x your bet!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The additional power of your Scatter is that landing four or more triggers the in-game free spins feature. This bonus round starts with 15 spins – yes, 15! But it doesn’t need to end there; you will get five additional spins when landing three or more Scatter symbols.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Gates of Olympus slot is also filled with multipliers with random values of 2x and up to 500x your winnings! Look for these in the form of round gems with golden wings. In the in-game free spins, these are cumulated on the upper left corner of your game window. The total is multiplied to your winnings at the end of the free spins rounds, making them extra rewarding!</span></p><h2><br><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></h2><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You get 15 free spins when depositing $25-49.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You get 40 free spins when depositing $50-99.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You claim the maximum 100 free spins when depositing at least $100.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Your free spins are valid for the game Gates of Olympus by Pragmatic.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Winnings generated by free spins must be wagered 35x.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Free spins are valid and must be wagered within 15 days upon activation. </span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Betfinal´s General Terms and Conditions apply.</span></li></ol>",

You can use it on pre-match bets. But the real fun will happen during the match as we offer the live stream and extra live betting opportunities.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">For now, it’s time to warm up and see what our Bundesliga bookies have to say about this fixture…</span></p><h2><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Bayern is favorite but…</strong></span></h2><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Bayern Munich will be the obvious favorite in its ground, at the Allianz Arena. The Bavarian team leads the German table with a solid 9-points lead on Dortmund. Now, the squad is looking for its 10<sup>th</sup> Bundesliga title in a row. When it comes to facing Dortmund, they should also feel confident considering they won their last seven games.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Now, here is an interesting fact: Bayern Munich vs Borussia Dortmund is the most played fixture in the German professional football. BVB is also the team that has most often stood up to the all-mighty German football leader. From all 130 games, Dortmund might have won just 32, but that’s more than any other opponent can say. Can the black and yellow squad surprise us this Saturday? Doubtful, but it’s going to be a great fight to watch!</span></p><h2><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Over 4 goals</strong></span></h2><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Games between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund usually involve a bonanza of goals. Their last ten clashes average over 4 goals total in the full time. In fact, the first league game ended in 2-3 for Bayern at the Westfalenstadion.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">So, who´s to score? Look no further than Lewandowski. The Polish striker is up 32 goals this season. But both teams boast tremendous attacks this 2021/22 campaign: Bayern scored 89 up to now, while BVB, 76. No other Bundesliga team is remotely close to that. Gnabry, Coman and even Müller are some of the most consistent scorers on Bayern’s side. While you should also keep an eye on Haaland, Reus and Wolf on Dormund’s side.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Regardless where you decide to invest your $10 Groundhopper free bet, we expect an action-packed game. So, remember that we also offer the live stream while you bet in our Betfinal live betting platform!</span></p><p> </p><h2><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></h2><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">To claim the Free bet, simply make a $10 deposit and select the Bonus from the available Bonus dropdown menu.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Free bet amount is $10.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Free bet is valid for any single bet on the game Bayern Munich vs Borussia Dortmund.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The qualifying deposit needs to be wagered at least once with min odds of 1.90 or 1.60 per selection in combination bets.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Free bet can only be claimed once per person/address/IP/device.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Any Free bet winnings will be credited to the player's account as cash and can be paid out without any further wagering requirements.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Betfinal´s General Terms and Conditions apply.</span></li></ol>",

These six hard-earned points place the Gunners back in the Top 4 of the Premier League. And with just seven matchdays left to the conclusion of the 2021/22 season, expect Mikel Arteta´s squad to fight for this position.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The visitors are favorite as they battle to remain ahead of their main rivals, the Spurs, fifth of the leaderboard and just two points behind Arsenal. For reminder, the EPL gets four direct qualifications to the Champions League, while ranks 5-6 play the Europa League. And Arsenal will visit the Spurs in just two weeks from now for a tense North London Derby with Champions in mind.</span></p><h2><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Who’s to score?</strong></span></h2><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Saka is in great shape and scored 11 goals for Arsenal this season. More importantly, the English winger was decisive in the recent victories against Chelsea and Man.U and we expect him to work his magic again at the London Stadium.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Arsenal also counts with one of the strongest goalies in the English League. So while Ramsdale holds the fort, we do not expect that many goals against the Gunners or overall. Aim between 2-3 goals within the regular time.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">On the other side of the pitch, West Ham is holding on to European play-offs at the seventh rank. While the Hammers only have one victory in the last five matchdays, they have surprised more than one team in the Europa League. They kicked out Sevilla in the Round of 16 and Lyon in Quarters.

With 81 points, only three losses the entire season and just four games to play until the conclusion of the 2021/22 campaign, the trophy is theirs.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Meringues also won the first leg at the Bernabéu 2-0 against Atlético Madrid. But here is the thing: we are giving Simeone’s team favorite to win at home, at the Wanda Metropolitano Stadium. While they might not have shown the same consistency as their derby rivals, they have a lot more to win now.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The “Colchoneros” are currently fourth of the leaderboard with 61 points. Above them, Barcelona is second with 66 points, Sevilla third with 64, while Real Betis is right behind on fifth position with 58 points. For reminder, La Liga offers four qualifications to the Champions league. So, the last four games will be crucial if Atlético wants to secure its participation in the ultimate European championship. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Atlético’s last four games will be against Elche, Sevilla and Real Sociedad. While Elche might be the easiest rival, Sevilla and Sociedad have had a strong season and, unlike Real Madrid, they still have much to fight for! Simeone’s men simply cannot miss on these three points at home against a rival they know well.</span></p><h2><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>What more to expect?</strong></span></h2><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Madrid derbies are always exciting. While Real showcases the absolute elite of worldwide football, Atlético is known to be a great challenger with very capable players in defense and offense alike. Recognizable for its usual 4-4-2 formation, the squad occupies the field and likes best playing on the counter. Expect few goals, but consider the red card bets with your free bet.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Should you look for players bets, Correa and Suárez are the favorite to score for the home team. As for Real, we would suggest Benzema as a sure bet, but it is yet hard to tell if Ancelotti will bring the big guns. Alternatively, young Brazilian Viní Jr is also in top form. Look also for Asensio and Rodrygo, two youngsters also that have shown consistency this season.</span></p><p> </p><h2><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></h2><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">To claim the free bet, simply make a $10 deposit and select the bonus from the available bonus dropdown menu.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free bet amount is $10.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free bet is valid for any single bet on the game Atlético Madrid vs Real Madrid.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The qualifying deposit needs to be wagered at least once with min odds of 1.90 or 1.60 per selection in combination bets.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free bet can only be claimed once per person/address/IP/device.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Any free bet winnings will be credited to the player's account as cash and can be paid out without any further wagering requirements.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Betfinal´s General Terms and Conditions apply.</span></li></ol>",

What’s original in Xxxtreme Lightning Roulette is that, once you’ve placed your bets, several random numbers are struck by lightning, adding multipliers of 50x up to 500x. So far, this should remind you of Lightning Roulette. The “Xxxtreme” addition is that lightning can strike the same numbers twice pushing the multipliers to 600x and up to 2,000x your winnings!</span></p><p> </p><h2><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></h2><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The minimum cashback amount is $10.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The maximum cashback is $100.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The cashback is granted on real money losses from Xxxtreme Lightning Roulette and in steps of $10.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The maximum stake qualifying for the cashback is $50 per game round.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The cashback is credited as bonus with 1 time wagering on any game from the Promo Tables under the Live Casino tab.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">This promotion is valid from May 12<sup>th</sup> at 0:01 UTC and May 25<sup>th</sup> 23:59 UTC.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Betfinal´s General Terms & Conditions apply.​​ </span></li></ol>",

This is the fourth fixture of the season between Chelsea and Liverpool. Despite the Reds ultimately winning the League Cup final via penalty, all three games ended in a draw in the regular time. And as you know, your 1x2 bets are settled on the latter.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Both teams will fight to the very end to win. Liverpool is hoping to lift a second trophy this season in addition to the League Cup – it could be the League or the Champions League, but it would most likely be the FA Cup. Chelsea missed its chance with the League Cup and is far off for the League, the FA Cup is the last trophy the Blues can aspire to this season. </span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Interestingly too, it’s Chelsea’s third FA Cup final participation in a row. But Tuchel´s squad lost the last two editions against Arsenal and Leicester. Could this third be the charm for the Blues?</span></p><h2><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>The almighty Salah</strong></span></h2><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Liverpool is having a fantastic season and Klopp really owes to his striking force. Jota and Mané are some of the best scorers in the league, while Salah leads the ball with more goals than both combined. The Egyptian sportsman is on top of his game and amongst the top scorers in all competitions. He will be Chelsea´s biggest nightmare this Saturday.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">And while Salah works his magic in the offensive side, Liverpool also counts on one of the best goalkeepers of the season with Alisson. Although, it will be tough for Chelsea to break through, look for opportunities to come from Lukaku and Mount. These have been some of the most consistent attackers on the Blues´ side.</span></p><p> </p><h2><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong> </span></h2><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">To claim the free bet, simply make a $10 deposit and select the bonus from the available bonus dropdown menu.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free bet amount is $10.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free bet is valid for any single bet on the game Chelsea vs Liverpool.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The qualifying deposit needs to be wagered at least once with min odds of 1.90 or 1.60 per selection in combination bets.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The free bet can only be claimed once per person/address/IP/device.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Any free bet winnings will be credited to the player's account as cash and can be paid out without any further wagering requirements.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Betfinal´s General Terms and Conditions apply.</span></li></ol>",

It consists of five reels, three rows and five paylines. You can play between $0.05 and $100 per spin. Simply select your preferred bet size from the chips stack symbol and press spin. You can win up to 3,000x your bet!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Alternatively, you can opt for the auto-play option and set a number of speed, a certain balance increase or decrease and a certain single win amount.

It’s a peaceful and easy game to play, unburdened with complicated features. There are five fixed paylines, which are: each line plus upward and downward arrow lines.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The cherry is the lowest paying symbol; however, you rip benefits when landing just two in adjacent reels – that’s already 5x your bet! Most other fruits pay when you land three to five in paylines – offering up to 1,000x your bet. More importantly, a full line of 7s pays off the most – 3,000x your bet!</span></p><p> </p><h2><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></h2><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You get 15 free spins when depositing $25-49.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You get 40 free spins when depositing $50-99.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You claim the maximum 100 free spins when depositing at least $100.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Your free spins are valid for the game Fruits & 777s by Spearhead Studios.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Winnings generated by free spins must be wagered 35x.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Free spins are valid and must be wagered within 15 days upon activation. </span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Betfinal´s General Terms and Conditions apply.</span></li></ol>",

All symbols start paying when you land three or more. While the fruits pay between 10x and 100x or 200x your bet, sevens and bars pay between 20x and 500x your bet! The stars are the highest paying symbols: land three for a winning of 50x your bet, four 500x your bet and five for a maximum winning of 2,500x your bet!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">However, the symbol you will be chasing most is the Wild Gold itself, which can appear on reels 1, 3 and 5. This is your expanding Wild symbol, substituting all others, thus creating the highest winning combination possible per payline. In fact, when in a winning line, the Wild Gold turns into a multiplier of 2x, 3x or 7x!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">To further boost your winnings, try your luck with the Card Gamble feature. This option is available on the right side of your gamegrid after each winning spin. You can bet on the color, Red or Black, or on the symbol of the card. While the color bet gives you a 50/50 chance of win and therefore pays 2x your winnings, the suit bet pays 4x your winnings. Should you win, you can keep on gambling and further multiplying your winnings. </span></p><p> </p><h2><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Terms and conditions:</strong></span></h2><ol><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You get 15 free spins when depositing $25-49.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You get 40 free spins when depositing $50-99.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You claim the maximum 100 free spins when depositing at least $100.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Your free spins are valid for the game Wild Gold by Spearhead Studios.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Winnings generated by free spins must be wagered 35x.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Free spins are valid and must be wagered within 15 days upon activation. </span></li><li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Betfinal´s General Terms and Conditions apply.</span></li></ol><p><br> </p>",

Just keep reading…</p><h2>How to play the Gemini Joker slot</h2><p>Gemini Joker is one of the latest additions to the BetSoft game portfolio. It’s a colorful slot consisting of five reels, three rows and five fixed paylines. You can bet between $0.10 and $10 per spin. To choose your preferred bet amount, use the “-“ and “+” buttons present under the reels. Press the big play button to start the reels. These will automatically stop within seconds and highlight the winning paylines for you.</p><p>Alternatively, you can use the Auto-play feature to choose between 5-100 spins at all available bet amounts. There you will also see your total bet before pressing the Spin button.</p><h2>Gemini Joker game features</h2><p>In addition to a sleek layout and eye-candy designs, Gemini Joker is filled with the best game features including Wilds, Respins, Multipliers and even a Wheel of Fortune. Let´s dig in!</p><p>Cherries, plums, watermelons, golden dices and diamond stars make up for the lowest paying symbols. You will need three to five to start collecting winnings. Gemini Joker offers an amazing bonus with its main symbols – the Stacked Reel Respin! There might just be five paylines, but when you fill up the first two reels with the same symbol without a winning, these reels are paused while you get a free Respin on reels 3, 4 and 5!</p><p>The symbols that you will be chasing the most are the two jokers. The red joker is your Wild symbol substituting all others to make the highest winning combination possible! The green joker, a mirror image of the first joker, is a Multiplier Wild symbol. In addition to substituting other symbols, it also multiplies your winnings. One green joker doubles your wins, two jokers quadruple them, and so on until you land five jokers for 32x your winnings!</p><p>Last but not least, should you fill up all reel positions with the same symbol, you’ll get a spin on the Multiplier Wheel, which awards a multiplier of 2x to 10x your winnings. You could win up to 1,700x your bet in fact!</p><h2>Terms and conditions:</h2><ol><li>You get 15 free spins when depositing $25-49.</li><li>You get 40 free spins when depositing $50-99.</li><li>You claim the maximum 100 free spins when depositing at least $100.</li><li>Your free spins are valid for the game Gemini Joker by BetSoft.</li><li>Winnings generated by free spins must be wagered 35x.</li><li>Free spins are valid and must be wagered within 15 days upon activation. </li><li>Betfinal´s General Terms and Conditions apply.<br> </li></ol>",

Here at Cosmoswin, the more you lose, the bigger the cashback gets.</p><p>For starters, after you lose your first $50 equivalent, we’ll return 10% of it as cashback.</p><p>Lose $150 equivalent and make it 15%! And if your losses go over $800, we’ll return a full 20% of the lost amount back to your account!</p><p>The minimum cashback for this Intergalactic promotion starts at $5 and goes all the way up to $10,000!
